"Good. You explain how it works, but how does it become monetarily valuable? It still seems wholly arbitrary and is susceptible to corruption at its base. Meaning it is only an extension of our existing financial schemata and not a means of democratic control. Or am I mistaken?",0,6,123

Thanks soo much sir for this excellent explanation.,0,,
So wouldn&#39;t it be that a company or set of companies uniting under a common goal hold a majority of the nodes and therefore reject the decentralization of the blockchain?

"Let&#39;s say, with block chain A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D, you tamper with block B. How would that affect all following blocks, or even just block D? Wouldn&#39;t tampering with B&#39;s hash only affect B&#39;s hash and C&#39;s previous hash?",0,,

"This was very good, but left me with a couple questions. How is mining done, I think I understand that it is the act of processing these transactions and generating the proof of work, but then somehow a bitcoin gets created and given to you for your &quot;work&quot; but at some point there will be no more bitcoins available, so why would anyone do the work of processing the proof of work anymore, and how would the ledger stay current?",0,,

Who are buy these pollution coins - that is what they are.  There are data centres pushing out billions of tons of CO 2 just to produce one of these so called bit coins.  In the UK it is the equivalent of 6 months electricity bill.  They are a disgrace and anyone who cares about our planet should get rid of them.  How the hell in these times of global warming has someone manged to produce an energy token.  It is rubbish to say renewable energy is used to make them.  Switch that renewable energy to national grids and stop more pollution.  What a folly these things are.  Please rename then to global warming coins.,0,,

"I love this video because he gives real strategies for growth of your holdings during unstable market times or even downward market periods.  However his explanation for why crypto is staked is let’s say imperfect.  Staking is a replacement and upgrade to traditional mining and less energy intensive.  It returns value similar to mining.  Without having a server/GPU farm.  Proof of stake is the next generation of coin creation and value creation. Bur before then, I&#39;ve been trading with Markenstech911com and it&#39;s very profitable",,,

"What the public is still not understanding is the real value underpinning any blockchain type of web3.0 ownership tokens or ‘coins’ is real world currency like the usd. E.g. no matter how much you proclaim blockchain to rewrite the financial establishment, people trading within the blockchain system will ultimately always cash out in real exchangeable assets underpinned by a currency…So blockchain really exists so solely within the control &amp; mercy of traditional value assets like paper currency…",,,

"I&#39;m iffy on blockchain.Decentralization sure, that seems really cool. I like the idea that we can create group oversight on transactions that doesn&#39;t require banks. But secure? It&#39;s harder to scam a system when there are many people maintaining records of it, but its not impossible. Also, the amount of energy required to have millions of people simultaneously keep records of innumerable transactions has been shown to be environmentally detrimental. This does not seem sustainable in its current form.",,,

"This is the time to invest in society did you miss the entire message ? We are able to create and manage service based token society’s. In a way social currency is becoming more of a reality ! The metrics used today are baseless and represent an industrial revolution style attitude. There is too much dissociative behavior happening. Central and 3rd party agencies have created a system of corruption, greed , consumption, life should not be a competitive race to be the richest, biggest , smartest! It’s a journey that we all share collectively and it’s time we take our lives back! We’re currently under a fiat system of imaginary numbers created by invisible hands with no transparency.

"You are woefully wrong about the source of energy used for bitcoin mining in China, they use mostly renewable energy such as hydro, wind and solar and operate close to the locations where energy are generated.  The locations where renewable energies are generated are often far away from urban centres so their prices are always low and that is why at its peak over 65% of bitcoin mining was done in China. Furthermore, as of now over 50% of energy generation installations in China are renewables, which is way more planet friendly than all of the five eyes countries where your stupid accent come from. Every time a British accent appears in a program, it inevitably tries to spout none sense about China. Just a bunch of jealous shop keepers.",,,

"Thanks for continuous great videos. The fact is, NFTs, BTC is the future of crypto and the question most traders ask themselves is - if this is right time to invest? I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in this space in general or probably just naive, the sphere have seen far worse times than this, enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions, I&#39;d say that more emphasis should be put into tradng, since it is way profitable than holing. Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 9 BTC when I started at 1.5 BTC in just 5 weeks of implementing trades with signals and insights from Collin Jianlin.

"As always great lectures MIT!!! Lemme know if you agree...back wen we wer kids, we had something called sportstar cards. We valued them like gold and traded it with other kids. It could be baseball players, cricket stars, WWE. Some cards were considered to be rare and traded against cards in numbers. If we look at bitcoin it resembles so, except that we can track the transactions and is digitized. Now, our parents would frown at our card collection, which required either money to buy, or snack items related. So here hv participants and non-participants. Imagine a few years later, you are not able to convince the non-participants to join in the Bitcoin rush. Will it resemble the cards we had as kids, which are no longer valued monetarily, but only amongst those few participants? The technology has its purpose though, undeniably.",,,

"Just imagine all these students who have certainly invested in crypto by that time, how much money haven&#39;t they done so far... Giz",,,
this is fun to watch but it&#39;s a waste of time. Each of the lessons in this course contains about 5 minutes of useful information. The rest is just conversation between the lecturer and the crowd,,,
He’s the 33rd chair of the SEC now,,,
yall looking at the head of the SEC,,,
I am sure all those that agreed with Tom has made a decent profit in this space.,,,

Thank you for the overview but jut have a couple questions. In a permissioned blockchain do all parties run an independent node to validate data integrity? Also how would blockchain perform better than a distributed database if it is just hinged on majority consensus?,,,
"I just have a question and I could not find the answer, would you guide me, please? I try to write my question in many different forms hopefully, you may get my question. I know what is blockchain and how it works, but I just want to know what kind of data are putted into blockchain transactions, I mean why the blockchain system is used for coding data? who is the sender of data that pay miners as bitcoin for trying to solve a block? who will receive the uncoded and completed blocks as a package? are blockchains governments classified information, that they wanted to transfer, or are such blockchain transactions just people daily transactions which spread out through the blockchain system (encrypted) as a safer, faster way with a non-central server room which can not be destroyed, produce too much heat or use too much electrical power in a local area or need repeatedly upgrades? I want to know the substance of the information which are coded through math equations and blockchain, senders and receivers of the information, and why they gave credit to such a huge encryption system that needs millions of miners to guess answers block by block? (byzantine algorithm) what kind of information can be that important to be coded like this? for example: all transactions, even generated bomb codes that are changing repeatedly and every 1-2 minutes can be safely encrypted with a simple hex 64. why the blockchain system created? and who use it as a tool to solve accidental math equations. I believe it is more likely for spying purposes for some governments. imagine you forgot the code of your suitcase (2 locks), and you don&#39;t want to try all numbers from 1 to 999 for each sides, so you hire 2 networks of people to find both answers separately, as soon as the answers found, the network members will verify it separately, and you will pay them but no group can open your pandora box because they just know one code of it and only you (the owner) have access to both solved codes. I am looking for THE OWNER of blockchains data who pay the system for solving such shitty math equations.",,,

It sounds to me you can only understand from this video if you already know.",,,
This was beautifully explained. I would love a series on the topic of Blockchain. Thank you IBM for this.,,,
"This is utterly useless to me, I&#39;m afraid. I stopped watching after a couple of minutes, totally lost in incomprehensible technicalities and terminology. Can you recommend an explanation that starts at a much lower level, please? Why use blockchain as opposed to other &#39;ordinary&#39; methods? What are the advantages, if any, of using blockchain? What alleged problems does it avoid or solve? What use is it, if you need a degree in IT to understand it?",,,
How will a permissioned blockchain reach a consensus.. if some part of it must be kept private only for a few people to be able to access that information?,,,

"A permissioned blockchain is a misnomer of blockchain.  If it is permissioned, it is not blockchain.   It already exists and existed before web 1.0.  All of the features exist and are in use today and have been in use for the last 40+ years before the internet, when large corporations had their intranet, and before then as hard-paper copy audit trails.  Part of the definition of blockchain is that it is permissionless.  You had your Freudian slip when you first misspelled &quot;Privacy&quot;.",,,

"QUESTION: What is the algorithm to be solved? And why is the first node to solve it given the right to create the new block? And how is that node rewarded?

"I just watched this, and is very interesting. Hopefully you read this because I have a question regarding &quot;writing the next page&quot;, which obviously means the ledger. In a bank, in order to update their ledger, whoever does that confirms that each new transaction is valid, one by one, before confirming it into the ledger. But in blockchain once someone &quot;earns&quot; the right to write the next page: how exactly do they confirm which transaction to include? You almost made it sound like that&#39;s unimportant (not one of the 5 elements). How do they make sure those transactions are valid?. And as someone already asked: how and where from do they choose which set of next transactions to approve? Since history cannot be re-written, sounds to me like this critically important.",,,

Brexit - the referendum when people in Britain decided they&#39;d rather their own government and legal system govern.

"At the end of the day, people act primarily based on incentives and none of those great benefits actually matter. Every body takes advantage of blockchain to increase their financial assets in dollar terms. Conditions alter incentive and people rush into making decisions that make the whole crypto thing volatile. It will destroy businesses and markets become unpredictable, except a few random lucky ones. The current financial system is a sophisticated beast developed through human history, survived and improved after every crisis, and a huge portion of it is still unknown. On the other hand we have this blockchain approach which sounds good in theory, but in practice every thing is different.",,,

Tj Quickly rises to the top of the food chain as the tycoon after starting out as a working stiff during recess and dethrones the former tycoon. TJ eventually captures every mon sticker to the point where all the kids have no choice but to switch the currency to lick and stick alien stickers making Mon stickers worthless literally overnight. TJ becomes a working stiff again. Episode is called &quot;Economics of Recess&quot;.,,,

I lost my job due to the Covid-19 Pandemic and life became so difficult for my family until my sister introduced me to a professional online  broker &quot;Maria Martinez&quot; who I invested with and in less than two weeks I received my profit and paid up all my debts, all thanks to Ms Maria for bringing joy back to my home once more.

"I invested in Tesla back in  2013, I was very much a bear,My reasoning was simple: Tesla was trying to do what no American automaker has done so far: Develop and sell a mass-market electric vehicle. It was trying to do what no American company had done in nearly a century: Start up a new auto manufacturing business. To take it a step further, I bought 40 shares from Tesla miners, investing about $1,800 in total with part of the proceed  from a 401(k) rollover. At the $908 per share price I sold at,that&#39;s a realized profit of $35,000! It may not be a life changing money, but it&#39;s an incredible return nonetheless,Now I am working with 3 asset Gold, Silver and Crypto all are good but crypto investment is the mother of them all, Crypto has followed this pattern for sometime now, it dips and gets everyone scared then after retesting an old resistance several times, we wake up one day to see it is bullish. This period is the perfect time to buy the dip and accumulate irrespective of the bulls being under pressure. Bitcoin moving up is inevitable and would see the price of bitcoin surpass it&#39;s all time highs. The reversal was imminent because obviously, the bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum  to give the bulls more steam and this just make it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible. I&#39;d strongly advice any newbie/traders to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering whether to enter the market or old time traders who are Holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89% trade accuracy. I underwent a series of trading losses I&#39;d best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst Expert Mrs Jessica Dave. My contact with her has being the hallmark of this year for me,under her careful guide and her signal service I&#39;ve been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1.2 btc to 4.6 btc in just 5 weeks.

I wish I had professors like you at school! Just a couple of litte questions, Anders. In the Coinbase section you list as a separate field the transaction Coinbase to Anders. First question: Do you mean Coinbase as the famous Coinbase company and so you are assuming that Anders receives money from a Coinbase transaction is his favour? What is the sense of repeating the same $100 coinbase -&gt; Anders in all next blocks ? Why on the last block there is a $100 Coinbase -&gt;Sophia? It seems not to make any sense as Sophia would not give out any further money to anyone in that block. Thank you very much again!",,,

Beautiful. Elegant. Concise. Perhaps the most productive 17 minutes I spent today.,,,
Absolutely Superb !  Now better way for a beginner to learn this !  Thanks a ton Anders.,,,
15:25 - Anders: &quot;It follows a basic rule of a currency. Like you can&#39;t invent it out of thin air.&quot;2017 - Literally every ICO: &quot;Hold my beer.&quot;,,,

a pride and prejudice as well as blockchain fan?  Is this my soulmate?,,,
I wish I could find this video before. Could save my lots of hours...a must watch..,,,
Best explanation ever!! thank you so so much for this.,,,
This is the best demo I have every seen for blockchain,,,
"Hey Anders, great work! But I have a question. Suppose we have three peers such as in your example. Let say Peer A and Peer B make same changes on the latest Block (Let say the write a completly egual addittional message in the data field) and they mine it afterwards to get a valid blockchain. So at the end we have three valid blockchains, but we know that the chains of A and B are the same but C is different. We also know, that C is the right one, but it looks like that C is manipulated, because it doesnt match with A and B. Would this scenario represent a perfect manipulation approach? When not, how can the system know that C is the right one and not A and B?",,,
This is indeed great video.  In last example Ryan did not get money still paying to others. How to validate it?,,,
can any one tell me how these blocks can be synced in peer to peer connection since we don&#39;t have any centralized storage.,,,
"Lots of news articles saying this can be a tool to evade censorship in china. Because how do you hide information? Everything you see on the computer screen are data (more explicitly, bits; zeroes and ones internally), which can be assigned to a hash, and to censor it requires tampering it, which will alter the hash and destroys the later blocks in the chain, the government can no longer view information of all the later blocks, and re-mining it does fix the chain, but does not reattaches the blocks being disconnected. Essentially you broke a real chain, reattach to the one you just created. Looks like if the government wants TRUE censorship that is unstoppable, that is only possible by removing the internet entirely, force all citizens and foreigners not to use computers that allow circumventions, and/or use the intranet.",,,
I have a doubt... 1) Lets say distributed network has 3 peers.. I go to peer A and lend him $1. Will it be reflected in peer B and peer C end ? But in the video 10:40 it is not the case . Why ?,,,
Best explanations about Blockchain!,,,
You rock... This is what I want...,,,

"what is the utility of having blocks be signed? if all hashes did not begin with four zeros, that would not break the ability to check for differences, we would still just check if the last hash of each peer is equal. So what functionality does requiring blocks be signed provide?",,,
THANKS!!!!,,,
Best explanation on YouTube. Thank you!,,,
"according to your video, mining cant help blockchain. so why we have mining in bitcoin?",,,
"A miner is a peer, but a peer may not be a miner. What does a peer (not miner) get (benefit) when join a blockchain, please?",,,
"Thank Anders for making this videos, very clear explantion. I have a couple questions:1. At 15:48 I&#39;m just curious why in Block 5, Coinbase $100 is named to Sophia, why not Anders?2. In the example above, 1 block may have 3 or 4 transactions, is that possible that 1 block may have different number of transactions, instead of fixed number of transactions?",,,
Incredible video!,,,
so clear to understand!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,,,
9:02 Distributed Blockchain,,,
"If you don`t know anything about blockchain, watch this video. After 17 mins, you will be the mentor for others :)",,,
"Also did a little bit of digging : here is what similar to yours “The Bitcoin protocol does not enforce anything from the wallet, asides requiring specific ECDSA curve to be used for key generation. If you happen to generate a keypair colliding with another keypair, congratulations, it&#39;s a very rare occurrence ! Same if your public key will hash into the same Bitcoin address (in theory you could have two different keypairs that have the same address associated with them).The consequence for such an occurrence is that both of the owners of the keys can spend the money associated with the corresponding address, not an ideal situation. If you are lucky, you might be able to steal someone&#39;s Bitcoins (but shame on you if you do), but most likely you&#39;ll just come across some address that was used only once, as the standard client has a tendency of generating new keypairs for every transaction in order to protect your anonymity.”",,,
Mate this is BY FAR the best BC explanation ever! thank you very much!,,,
"Hey Anders, Quick question :Given 6 billion people, its possible that 2 people may have the same private key (lets say 1) , will the chain collapse or get corrupted ? What prevents that ?",,,
You are a Life Saver. .. Super Like!!!!!!,,,

Excellent video. Simple enough that you don&#39;t need to know anything about blockchain to follow but technical enough that you can understand the fundamentals behind how a blockchain actually operates.,,,
15:33 - “You can’t create money out of thin air”The federal reserve begs to differ,,,
Loved the video! If anyone is interested in learning more about Blockchain subscribe to my channel ! Posting weekly videos and always open to posting anything you want to hear.,,,
"please don&#39;t use the word &quot;signed&quot; for a correctly mined block.Signed is when you use a private key to create a digital signature for transactions.Terminology is important, use it right.",,,
It finally starts to make sense!,,,
Perfect explanation! Thank you.,,,
Best explanation for block chain. Thank you,,,
"How come the last block has coin base 100 Sophie, can anyone explain pls ?",,,
Excellent!,,,
why are we concerned with 4 zeroes placed initially?  why noy any other number of zeroes?,,,
Thanks for BEST EVER EXPLANATION !!! Question: how did Anders get his first 100 ? (talking about the 1st ever transaction),,,
super clear explanation! thank you for sharing!,,,
The best explanation of Block Chain concept with an example. Thank you and appreciate for your time and effort!,,,
nice video sir,,,
"Absolutely fantastic, thank you.",,,
"Hello sir , thanks for creating such a wonderful video on blockchain ..Can u please help me i wanted to know where can i do the more practicals on blockchain and what should i do to dive into more deep .Hope for early reply",,,
what a great videoreally awesome,,,
dude seriously this is the best of the best explanation ever created/visualized. you are the man! thank you!,,,
"Hello Anders, one question... On the last section of this video, when you demonstrate the blockchain with the signatures, at that moment, the transfer already happened and the block is only recording the transaction into the ledger ,or the transaction is occurring during this block miner?",,,
This was amazing thank you!!,,,
Free xrp,,,
"I am from Jamaica, can believe I am listening to a semester of lecture from MIT... Bless be God.. Thanks MIT",,,
Can some link the readings here,,,
that base 2 to base 10 conversion trick/estimation at 35:55 was pretty genius and smart btw...for anyone who didnt catch that. shows hes pretty quick on his feet and knows quite a few math tricks,,,
"Who is here being reminded of how much has changed in just 3 years!! Just a mind blowing that Bitcoin was worth $6,500 when this lecture was being recorded.",,,
"this is a wild video, like outside of the informative nature of it. seeing Gensler talking about needlessly printing money a whole year before the pandemic, and noting one of the creators of Algorand over 6 months before it launched. shows have far we have come in only 3 years",,,
then surety is satoshi nakamoto....not the cofounder...i guess,,,
"3rd class doing all the readings, see you in the 4th lesson.",,,

"Not a fan of cronies, but it is amazing that this guy is still learning complex new stuff in his 60s, most people in their late 20s give up on learning new stuff.",,,
"Im half way, my notes for questions:1. Why timestamp needed at all, if the order of blocks what’s matters 2. How can nonce guarantee we get output hash with zeros? Could such nonce nonexistent",,,
Sirs concept on the cryptography are a little off :/,,,
"This is the best way I have found to learn about this new tech. Doing the readings, the assigments and everything and the questions from the people there are really good too. Thanks for sharing it MIT.",,,
This class is so entertaining I’m awestruck,,,
This is a very helpful and clear class.  Thanks.,,,
Thanks MIT for sharing knowledge with the world!,,,
thank you MIT and Prof Gensler for this free lecture series! didnt think think I&#39;d rather watch a college lecture than Netflix but now I know I do.,,,
It&#39;s hard to not impressed by his wit and perception.,,,
"A PRAISE FROM A 20 YEAR OLD BLOCKCHAIN LOVER (YES ME) :- Dear professor gensler , your COMPUTATIONAL power is really great. You are a genius, we love how you are defining this brutal technology in an interactive and fun way,  I swear I&#39;ll attend all the classes and I&#39;m also preparing notes and trying to do the homework you offer. THIS CONTENT WORTH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. GREAT . WE ALL ASPIRANTS ARE BLESSED",,,
What is the video that professor keeps referencing ?,,,
47:12 the writings on the white board!!? Wonder what class happened before this,,,
lol the auto subtitles can&#39;t always handle GG&#39;s accent. Tree becomes &quot;tray&quot; etc..,,,
Does anyone know where one can get the study questions and reading lists?,,,
Does anyone here has the link of the video they refer to at 50:50?,,,
I never imagined that MIT could have such a low level of teachers. The man interrupts himself and makes a digression every three minutes. He is irritating. The nan does not specify definitions and looks  very insecure. He asks the audience for help as a singer who has lost his voice and really has very little knowledge of the matter.,,,
"I came here to understand the expensive Blockchain that I paid for. Yeah, this is the study bible of the Blockchain technology.",,,

Crash &amp; Burn describing it@ 1:1:16,,,
The information I learned from these 3 classes are very informative and fascinating. I appreciate  everyone who made this far.,,,
What a amazing method of teaching - No brainer why he is the SEC chairman,,,
these classes are amazing. thank you for posting them!,,,
"Congrats to everyone who&#39;s made it this far! It&#39;s interesting how the view count dips so fast the further into the series you get! If you consider the number of people that then do the corresponding readings, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s even lower. Still, the knowledge is there for those of us willing to put in the time and effort! Blessings to all!",,,
"Positive feedback to MIT open courses as a whole &amp; Gary Gensler&#39;s class in particular.Thank you MIT for making this and your previous technical courses available.  While I am typically a passive listener of educational content, professor Gensler and the student engagement in this course is really terrific.   I feel obligated to provide the following feedback.For what is worth, here&#39;s my critique of the course so far.  The first two classes had great tidbits about the history of money and finance...but I really enjoyed watching this 3rd lecture tackle the abstract concept of how (cryptography) algorithms could provide technical safeguards in the potential presence of an adversarial actor.  Felt like the Prof was still looking for a more perfect/tangible analogy of a HASH value.  Also (as with the previous lectures) I enjoyed the technical tidbits about how big a blockchain header is relative to the size of the blockchain.  This lecture seemed to demonstrate the caliber of students at MIT in addition to the impressive professors.",,,

‘How’s my math?’ What a boss,,,
"Thank you very very much for this series, I’m learning a lot. Those who want to dig deeper on RSA, hash functions, elliptic curve cryptography, and random-number generation can probably benefit from a specialized book on the subject.",,,
Thank you @@,,,
I’m astonished by the quality of this lectures and it’s free! Thank you so much I really appreciate this MIT,,,
"This really is incredible, never thought I&#39;d be so intrigued learning about block chain!",,,
real sharp guy,,,
This guy is now chairman of the SEC. But he’s not doing anything for the industry. So disappointing,,,
hard flex 36:09 lmaoo,,,
"Thanks MIT, MIT has made me think that I am now MIT, not at MIT...",,,
The UTXO was a crucial piece he left out when trying to explain the public key impersonation question. Can anyone confirm this?,,,
Why does  the miner have to reward by creating a new coin?,,,
Love this!Thank you MIT!,,,
These slides are exceptionally good. Great learning curve and the professor makes learning blockchain very exciting. I would highly recommend anyone who wants to do anything with crypto to watch this course.,,,
"Prof. Gary made a mistake with Base58&#39;s functionality, which is not designed to compress data, but to make binary data trasmitted over network easily and more visual friendly. The cons of Base58 is it makes data size bigger, not smaller.",,,
how does Gary retain all this knowledge ? unbelievable,,,
"Gary Gensler earned a whole new level of respect from me , this damn guy is a genuis",,,
Mr Gensler provided very detailed explanation about bitcoin and its cryptography.. could he be Satoshi Nakamoto or the part of the group??,,,
I love this guy!!,,,
"is it me the only person wondering how did Gensler approximate 0.5^128 to 10^(-40)? What, is he a walking AI?",,,
Made it to lecture #3.  Might have to watch this one twice lol.  Wish that the sound quality was better.,,,
I never thought I would ever be watching an MIT lecture and basically already understand all of it.,,,
"I love these lectures, even if some the students are the &quot;one-upped you&quot; kinda people.",,,
i wonder if these students bought bitcoin,,,
I think I am going to buy some xrp,,,
"Truly a hidden gem of YouTube, thank you for the amazing content",,,
Anyone know where I can get the readings/literature for this course?,,,
There were a couple of double spends on btc in July 2021 after they changed protocol from its original whitepaper. Does it mean btc could fail in time like the others stated in previous class?,,,
Thanks!,,,
"54:38 the subtitles say mem pull, which is wrong. It is &#39;mempool&#39;.",,,
"If there is any room to comment on the production value on these priceless resources, would you consider upping the gain on Prof. Gensler&#39;s microphone about 10 or 15db?  These videos are pretty quiet compared to the rest of youtube.",,,
Is there a black lung equivalent for Bitcoin miners?,,,
Thankyou,,,
How about a thankyou to MIT and all the kids that paid to attend and distribute to us if they didn&#39;t want us to have we wouldn&#39;t,,,
Thank you,,,
47:15 this guy read my mind. I had the same doubt here,,,

"A terabyte is one trillion bytes - as in a &quot;one&quot; with twelve zeros after it. As in 1,000 gigabytes (one thousand billion bytes)",,,
"The question at 49:45, the lecturer misunderstood/mis-answered (or was it me?)I think the point being made by the student is that: Assume some random set of transactions (and other bits) that produce a collusion with an existing hash in the blockchain.The probability that all of those transactions are also simultaneously valid is very low, and therefore the block would be rejected in many cases - thus reducing the number of possible collisions.Or put another way, it&#39;s not sufficient to find a set of transactions (and nonce etc) that produce the same hash, those transactions must also be completely valid for the starting ledger state.",,,
I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a better way to explain this but once I get it I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll not have the time to go over it with someone how I figured it out myself.,,,
"This is a great lecture but I am confused by which order everything occurs. In order to mine the next block, don&#39;t the transactions from the current block have to be completed as indicated by the merkle root hash? Wouldn&#39;t that make for a lot of wasted time that miners could be mining? How can you be continuously guessing nonces if the transaction list is not fully determined?",,,
"China received, studied, applied blockchain technologies for the digital yuan, kicked out all miners and cryptousers in the summer of 2021. The consequences for China are negative, the crypto community is positive.",,,

Are these students representative of the intelligence of the average MIT student?,,,
"Hmm... using the same money twice. Sort of like creating synthetic shares, eh?",,,
Audio volume low.,,,
thankyou for this video. I want to ask about technical presentation. How to switch between slide and presenter? is there an operator to operation this? thank you,,,

"A block chain uses encryption to protect its contents. It&#39;s peer to peer and no middle men.. Well only when it&#39;s used in a decentralized protocol. The government is much more corrupt in it&#39;s use of blockchain technology. Never trust government issued crypto. It&#39;s just a way to track your every movemt, transactions, and even steal from you or shut your crypto off when you dont listen. A better version of crypto  uses no government entities such as bitcoin or  ethereum. Even then you have to be careful enough to avoid custodial services.

Thank you!,,,
"Great video. But I still can&#39;t help but correct it. These things are bugging me to a breaking point. So many miss-consceptions. It&#39;s in the literature itself.Blocks are hashed, not necessarily encrypted. Encryption isn&#39;t necessary when its already public and permissionless. You missed the important part of it. Ie: the chain, where the name comes from.Blockchains aren&#39;t necessarily decentralized, they can be centralized. Bitcoins is not, same with most cryptos as they are intended to be anti-government.Satochi didn&#39;t invent or propose the blockchain. Just look again at the paper itself, the timestamp server is even cited in the paper... Their &gt;only&lt; contribution, big but only, was using previous work in a way to have a working system that is permissionless and public with no central authority without having the issue of double spending.Not new, a different perspective.Also keep in mind that NFT&#39;S must first be accepted in law for ownership to actually matter. Though the potential is there, right now it doesn&#39;t legally represent anything. Because at the end of the day, we live with governance.Otherwise great job",,,

I think the comparison between the nft and a paintibg doesnt really hold up that well. A poster of the mona lisa is not even close to the original and it is just impossible to get an exact copy of the original. With art that is purely stored as data there can be an infinite amount of perfect copies and the only thing the nft owner has over any copy owner is the recognition of the ledger,,,

If I own an NFT of Nyan Cat, I don&#39;t own it&#39;s copywrite, I can&#39;t control who gets to see it, I can&#39;t really monetise it. Personally I don&#39;t equate NFT with the same kind of ownership as actually owning a physical piece of art or media.",,,

"ya know, this was a great explanation of bitcoin and block chains and what is ultimately the appeal of this type of currency at all. However, there is strong reason to believe that the obsession of possession of these types of &#39;it&#39;s mine and you can&#39;t have it&#39; things is ultimately a poor way to progress the world. Art has value, personal information has value, and a reliable record of events has value.But art has no value if it cannot be shared, personal information has value only in how it links to an individual and can assist that individual, and trustworthy records of events only have value in that they can be interpreted by anyone who wishes to check the record.None of the things have something that NFTs even has a chance to properly provide security value for over their inherent values.",,,

I know there are new alternatives such as proof of stake in the works but it&#39;s glaring to gloss over such a inextricably linked side effect. I also don&#39;t understand the desire of absolute ownership, surely rapid and incessant consumerism scratches the itch to &#39;own&#39;. Perhaps it does for most.",,,

"still doesnt explain why owning anything currently on the blockchain as an NFT matters. the nyan cat gif for example, who cares who owns it? why does it matter? if I want to use the gif, ill just do so.",,,
"My issue with NFT ownership is that most of the artwork and historical clips being sold are not original or unique. I don’t care about that for “hipster’s sake”. I care because they serve no utility to the owner if a digital copy exists. The digital copy in the hands of the creator can still generate revenue (think of the NBA clips, the owner doesn’t gain royalty rights of that clip when they own the NFT). The copy in the hands of the public I not the same as owning a poster of the Mona Lisa, because the digital art work copy could be identical to the NFT (save for unique hash for ownership).That being said I think people are innovating in the space, the purchase of digital real estate, or horses in a racing game are clever applications of a tool.This was a great piece on NFTs and crypto technology.

"Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has been a major talking point between my colleague and staff at work and so last year i decided to go into deep in it not withstanding my little knowledge in it and how I can equally benefit from it. After doing some research and watching several videos on how it work I decided to give it a try and guess what I bought 5 BTC, and I left it in my wallet expecting the price to increase in some months time because before the year ended in 2017 the price was more x20 of what it was in January that same year and this was done following the instructions I got from my colleague but the profit I expected never came, in short, the reverse was the case. So I decided to do deep research on how I can profit and gain more value for my coins  but some trading I did turned out negative. And so I continued my research until I found a beginners trading post talking about a strategy on how to trade and make profit. I was skeptical of first but I decided to give it a try and contact the person in charge, Mr. Dominic Connor, he explained to me the different ways to make profit in this bearish market. I invested 2 BTC of my coin, and it quickly rose to 6 BTC towards the end of December 2018, and I was convinced that this is the best way to make a good profit from Bitcoin. If you&#39;re still confused about the steps to take this year I urge you to contact her on  whatsapps +447476064297 or her telegram carolinenymanfor all your cryptocurrency questions, strategy and beginners coaching.",,,

"In the past, we have middle men to help manage our transactions. It&#39;s centralisation depending on the middle men like banks or government agencies. If the banks and the government want to steal money from us, they can easily do just that and we cannot know. Blockchain has completely changed and cut the middle men. It&#39;s decentralisation - everyone can verify your transactions and they get reward in the form of bitcoin for example. The central agencies cannot steal money because if they want to steal money, they have to change the information of around 51% each members in the blockchain holds. It&#39;s impossible to do just that!",,,

"Great Content.Many people have been complaining about trading, trading is an art that requires maximum focus and attention. Trading is a lucrative opportunity as it leverages the market volatility and right now is a good time to take advantage of the market. This is because the market is unpredictable, and traders must react quickly to price moves. Also, in the absence of these two key ingredients, a trader might suffer a huge loss.

"If you see comments here about investing or brokers, they are scams.  Videos about cryptocurrencies, evidently including ones that are just about the underlying technology/math, are hotbeds for attracting nefarious actors preying on the impressionable.Also, hi!  If you’re new to this channel, most of it is about visualizing math. I get it, you probably landed here searching for how BTC works, not to spend your afternoon getting pulled into learning about, say, prime numbers or problem-solving, but if you have a moment take a look at the rest of the channel, you may enjoy what you find.",,,

"Excellent video, but I do have a problem at 20 mins 40 secs. Alice has sent a fraudulent block and is the current block winner. Alice’s hash is used in the next blockchain so how is there a branched version as no one would go on to make a hash for that block as the mining reward has been taken by Alice. Secondly are the transactions are different for each miner depending on which transactions get recorded due transaction fees and network latency and each miner ends up with a different ledger?",,,
"Prior to watching this I didn&#39;t really understand the link between mining and validating the transactions. Its quite interesting how the system can self-adjust to make sure that mining\validating is always profitable, and therefore even if there is a big crash in mining profitability it should just result in a slowdown of transactions until the system balances. I guess the issue is that there is a big problem if the coin is used for real large scale commerce\business that rely on guaranteed volume. If a large enough proportion of bitcoin transactions were for real vital goods and services, then a crash in mining profitability could drive he value to zero since the value would be much more tied to the amount of volume the system can handle. Lack of trust could continually inflate it, which would then continually make it harder to restore validation capacity. Volatility is an issue for real world business even if the overall trend is continually upwards. If I am correct, then it would suggest that bitcoin will remain a speculation asset and a store of value rather than a replacement for sovereign currencies?",,,
Still confused with why proof of work can ensure every transactions of the new block valid? even someone taking computational effort on mining new block does not mean those efforts proving that Bob really transfer 1 dollar to Alice.,,,
"I can guarantee that 80% of you that say this video is 100% clear, did not in fact fully understood how it works. Or, you watched it after watching another X videos beforehand, and had already previous understanding.Because if you just watched this for the first time, it raises more questions then answers, as it doesn&#39;t cover everything.",,,

"23:21 &quot;purely optionally,&quot; my ass. Damn gas fees.",,,
amazing explanation!,,,
One thing I still don&#39;t understand how a cryptocurrency is &quot;initiated&quot;. I mean I understand that you can verify your current balance and that of all the other users by tracking transactions that cannot be forged but where do you get them from the first place? I assume you can&#39;t just write a transaction that says &quot;I get 100 whatevercoins&quot; without taking it from some other user that already has those coins and signs the transaction with their private key because that would make this whole system pointless. How does the first &quot;entity&quot; get the coins to transfer them to other users later and what assures that either them or any other user won&#39;t do so again?Edit: Ok so I rewatched the video and from what I understood the only type of transaction that can produce coins out of nowhere are the block rewards. That being said I still don&#39;t understand how you can &quot;verify&quot; those. You get some amount of coins for mining a block but how is that value decided and what prevents one from just adding as much of these reward transactions as they want?,,,
"apart from all stupid videos, this is the one I wanted to see. I still think of people buying bitcoin without knowing the bitcoin.great video!!",,,
Well I&#39;m still confused at least now I understand why I don&#39;t understand crypto.,,,
Words can&#39;t express the gratitude I feel when I think about what   you have doneI&#39;ll just say thanks for the coins,,,
"Hello, 3B1B, HAPPY NEW YEAR; can you do a similar video regarding the difficulty of persons 12, 15, or 24 seed words (keys) to their cryptocurrency wallet being compromised. With over 250,000 English words in existence. I need your math graphics to make me feel better about my crypto security. Stay SafeKind Regards",,,
"I recommended a professional broker to you guys sometime ago, can I get a person who invested with herComment belowLet&#39;s go",,,
Excellent video! Please do one on proof of steak!  Thank you!,,,
So a bit coin is just a list of verified transactions and the money people make from is for collecting those lists? Like messenger boys getting paid a nickel for delivering the news? That kinda makes sense to me,,,
"TA is all well and good but I find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as it seems. It&#39;s kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 11 btc from day tradng with bryan, insights and signals in less than 2 weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish.....",,,
"The proof of work makes no sense to me. So when you are ready to broadcast that you made a transaction, you have to wait 6 years till you calculate a SHA256() that outputs a number starting with 60 0s?Edit: I watched more and it makes sense now lol",,,
it&#39;s like a debit card minus the customer service &amp; FDIC that a bank offers..,,,
Fantastic.,,,
Really great video! Thanks!,,,
Nice to have this explained so calm and clear. Thanks.,,,
This is the video that opened the world of crypto for me. Thanks for that!,,,
Please make a Video about the details of a Hash Function like SHA 256,,,
Is the best to mining with no additional fee needed,,,
"Awesome video! When looking at block chains and the idea of decentralized money, I don&#39;t see why the leger has to be decentralized. Why couldn&#39;t you just code the middle man style leger to only run on a predetermined protocol? You could just have all transactions require a signature from both parties then lock the website in an autonomous state. I imagine the way nuclear launch buttons required multiple keys from different people and how if you wanted to edit the protocol, you would just obtain the signature of a majority of the users. That way, you don&#39;t have to deal with the nonsense witch is bit mining and you can just have all of the transactions running through a single protected source, kind of like a VPN.",,,
Thanks!,,,
"Bitcoin is owed and totally owned and controlled by China like most exchanges, and the USA had no choice but to kill it.  The people that own the most bitcoin and it went into the millions would rule the world, can’t happen. This is all my opinion, do your home work on Bitcoin, who owns most of it , its beginning, the exchanges etc. Don’t be fooled by the ban.",,,
"Great video. Thank you. Have there been any simulations or studies performed to find out if the use of bitcoin instead of fiat money would be feasible? meaning, since there are millions of transactions around the world everyday, would it be able to keep up? since it is keeping a block chain of all transactions being made, wouldn&#39;t it at some point become so large that is unmanageable?",,,
Man must be a Crypto Millionaire atleast by now,,,
"Perfectly unbiased, informational video!",,,
"its about Bitcoin, not &quot;blockchain&quot;. Bitcoin is the only revolutionary technology here. Altcoins are all essentially centralised shitcoins used to dump on retail by VC.",,,

"Just a silly question: Say in the foreseeable future, the reward of generating a new block becomes almost negligible while the amount of transaction keeps growing due to the prevalence of the crypto. Who is going to do the dirty work of generating new blocks?",,,
I invest a little amount and it generates 50000 USD from is mining,,,
What stops miners from increasing the reward in their blocks,,,
Nope. Still don&#39;t get it.,,,
"Am I the only one who doesn’t understand the Alice, Charlie, and Bob ledger example? If Bob recorded that “Alice pays Bob $100” but it didn’t actually happen, what’s the harm done to Alice? If this was wrongly presumed to be true by the group, wouldn’t Bob therefore owe Alice $100 since she was the one who allegedly paid him the money??",,,
I SECRETLY OWNED 20K BITCOINS AS I HAVE BOUGHT THEM BACK IN 2009,,,
oh boy did i wish i was old enough to buy some crypto back then without my parents interfering :(,,,
"03:10 I really don&#39;t get this part. Why do Alice and Bob owe money and Charlie and (You) get money?If Alice pays Bob 20$ and later on Alice receives 10$ from (You), she&#39;s still 10$ in negative. Same with Bob: He receives 20$ from Alice but then pays 40$ to Charlie, so he&#39;s 20$ in negative.Shouldn&#39;t Alice/Bob GET 10$/20$ and the other ones OWE 10$/20$ ?",,,
Y cant now one explain it in easy English words,,,
I&#39;d love a follow-up on proof of stake,,,
DOES THIS GUY KNOW HOW TO PARTY OR WHAT!!!!,,,
"I wouldn&#39;t touch it with a barge pole. I have no doubt it works etc however the computing power required to run the whole economy is just daft. Secondly its very exposed to internet failures and hacking to break the process as with denial of service. Think what would happen if some rouge system listened to every transaction, altered 1 bit and resent, all receivers would invalidate the transactions and wait for the next valid one which would also likely be invalid, pretty soon the internet would be flooded and so would the miners ( isnt this true? ) How about a large number of miners are in China because the power is cheap, all of China&#39;s networks go through CCP firewalls so what happens when the CCP decide to turn off the internet connections to these miners or just corrupt the messages ( how easy would that be for the CCP or the US etc ? )",,,
20:23 why miners don’t see Alice fraudulent block and do not just work on it and subsequently include it in blockchain? What prevent them from doing that?,,,
Please i really want to invest and earn from trading but i don&#39;t know any reliable broker.. Any ideas..?,,,

how does bitcoin work?talk about crypto in the media long enough and the children growing up will be so used to the idea that when it is implented as a central bank digital currency and forced upon all then there will be no protests since in the childrens heads (whom are now all grown up) this is normal.take your masks off - you are being duped!,,,

"This is the best video I&#39;ve seen yet on crypto, thanks!OK, up next: please explain the point of NFTs?!?As far as I can work out, they are basically a &#39;hashcode&#39; representing a transaction in a block chain, is this correct? If so, then they are really just fancy electronic receipts and have no intrinsic value?Also, anyone have any links to alternatives to &#39;proof of work&#39;? I do like the idea of a distributed currency, but not one that pointlessly wastes energy.And am I correct in thinking &#39;proof of work&#39; is really just a way of inserting a delay between when transactions are received and when blocks are broadcast?",,,
"PLEASE, I MEAN REAALYCould You make the continuation of the “crypto”-series by describing the notion of tokens?How are they created?How do they appear in the chosen blockchain (of the coin)? I.e consider smart-contracts - as an “alternative”(?) to mining…At least on the example of Etherium blockchain! I heard that tokens info appears in the “already existing” blocks - the technicalities here seem really interesting (or at least you wait for the new blocks to be created (mined) for token info to be added - which makes more sense in the context of the video). How does then this unique feature of Etherium-like (token-friendly) block(chain)s “looks like”?This theme (tokenization) is of a highest importance in practical matters (especially, given rising popularity of the NFT-based video-games, etc)+ it also constitutes the generalizarion of the info in this video, since (for instance) not all blockchains are created via mining. Your videos is literally the only source that gives the relevant info in a relevant way, so pls help us all!)",,,
"Bit coins dont actually exist, they are Virtual. Dont invest in things that arent there unless you are super stupid.",,,

"heyy over here, the &quot;message&quot; is the data that u send right? For example, the message could be some transaction like Bob sent 50$. So it is in a way public right?",,,

"If every transaction is signed by the payer, how exactly does the proof-of-work help? No one else (not even the central authority) will be able to modify the transactions into new valid ones, because they don&#39;t have the secret keys. I don&#39;t get in what scenario the proof of work helps.",,,

"BTC is not acting like its at a bottom. It feels like denial out there. Over the past 5 years the broadening or megaphone pattern has become THE dominate TA pattern in the stock market as more public participation comes into the market. If you draw a broadening pattern with 47k as the mid point. You could be looking at 24k-25k as the bottom. To me, this makes the most sense give what is happening in the QQQ&#39;s and the NTC sentiment out there. Every youtuber is looking up to the sky. 25k would buck everyone off the train. A retest of the middle is common in these patterns, so a move to 47k could be in the cards. If its rejected there, you need to look a LOT lower. I have played safe by putting my assets into active trades,so I don&#39;t feel the price if the declination continues.I have made over 8.5 btc since early november till date from implementing trades with insights and infos from Tom Canfield.I will advise everyone to stick to this method instead of just waiting on a pump.You can reach Tom on ͲeIєɠɾαmTomcanfield",,,

Fantom on the raise with a little help from Hector Dao!,,,
"While bitcoin’s wild &lt;price movements might seem random, they are often driven by the same fundamental catalysts as in the traditional markets. Some claim bitcoin is impervious to shocks that affect global finance; it’s a hedge against things like inflation and a sure bet against tides of uncertainty. Moves within traditional finance can boost or burn bitcoin’s price because they determine how easy it is for financial epicenters like Wall Street to invest in bitcoin...Keeping all this in mind, it is important to trade with the right strategy when going into the crypto world. Jennifer Signals has been doing a great job reviewing all chart, trade and techniques on BTC which has enhance the growth of my portfolio to 19 BTC lately.&lt;You can reach Jennifer on ͲeIєɠɾαmJenniferwilbur",,,

"Amazing content here sir, Has you have mentioned there are tons of projects that will 10X and your choice are spot on in my honest. Looking at the broader markets In case you wondered, we are looking at a 5-fold range bound fractal. This must be the rangiest range I&#39;ve seen in years for Bitcoin. The vast majority of discretionary traders tend to become more and more hopeless as the range box develops. It&#39;s a patience test failed by many. This is a pivotal moment and that&#39;s why the majority will regret. If it goes down, people say: why haven&#39;t I sold If it goes u, people say: why haven&#39;t I bought &gt;&gt;In September 2021 bulls trapped the bears, check the lower wick on 21th of September and now a buy signal has been given which strongly indicates a final bottoming process is locked. One of the scenario&#39;s from career trader Callum Lucas is that bulls will use the same trick, as his automated sig- nals based on unique combinations of trend, momentum and volume scanners supports this thesis. So far I&#39;ve accumulated over 8BTC trading with it. If interested then reach out through Te\ᒪE Gᖇαm callumlucas",,,

&lt;Great info and insight as always.It&#39;s kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. A lot has changed and that&#39;s on everything but the truth is I don&#39;t even care much about bullish or bearish market anymore because Adam Joel got me cover as I have made over 7btc from nov till date.

"This follows my pattern I have been talking about! George check out what pattern I am talking about on my channel! It talks about how we are in another 3 month Bear market within a giant overall Bull Run to actively create lengthening cycles come true. They prolonged the bull market by 3 months the 1st time with Elon fud China ban, and other reasons that caused the 3 month pull back. Now if you compare the last 3 month bear market within a bull run and this one they are almost exactly the same and if that is true I know when we are going to blast off!",,,

Bear market = market down 20% or more for 60 days+....we&#39;re in bear territory 100%...buying the dip every week,,,
It&#39;s an equities version of a bear market within an overall crypto bull market.,,,
The &quot;bull market&quot; ended in the spring of &#39;21. Since then we&#39;ve pretty much been in a stagnant/quasi-bear market. Where it goes from here is anyone&#39;s guess.,,,
If this is not a bear market then sheesh I hate to see what it does look like.,,,
Unknown is what spooks markets until the known becomes actual reality until you get Biden out this is the future and that&#39;s because this administration is anti small businesses. They are pro bankers,,,

Think of the poor people that bought in the 60 s,,,
One absolutely sure fire way for the entire market to the moon. I tend to buy close to the high and get scared enough to sell near the bottom. If I just sell while I&#39;m down over 50% including alt coins it will rip up to $100k,,,
Def bear market. Just accept it already,,,
Never disappoints. This channel always get the stupidest questions.,,,
Smells like a bubble,,,
Who also watches George at 2x Speed because he talks too slow?,,,

Take some profit if you have any left and put on the side so you can be prepared for the downside…We are 100% in a downtrend and unless we get a higher high on macro we’re going down..potentially a lot further.. We don’t hold 39k…going to 33k…if that breaks…low to mid 20s…if that breaks…we’re all poor,,,

"Crypto Price Prediction said that Bitboy, Ran, and Alex Shilled for donkey and are still raking in the profits from duping their listening audience. Is this true???",,,
"&gt;??People has increased their bids in hopes of making huge gain from the rise but as we can see now the market is very unstable, the truth is that you can always make more profit from trading rather than just hold and waiting for the price of BTC to skyrocket, Indeed its a tough decision for both old and newbies whose intensions are just to hold and sell but rather the potentials of trading Btc would allow you grow your Btc not minding the present price chart and also saving your ass from any future dip that may occur, I started tradin with Greg kaplan since 4weeks   and till date i have made over 12.5 Btc even with the ups and downs.

You can&#39;t do that with physical assets. Someone would have to physically steal it from you. Physical assets only. I made an absolute killing during the Obama crash on gold and silver.

The easiest way of all to earn money from your crypto may be to deposit your funds into a platform that offers you an annual percentage yield (APY) on the money you hold on their platform.

My god.. I’m a Pavia holder but you should really verify your data with the project. It’s great you highlight it but let’s have the data correct,,,
CeekVR metaverse is going to crush it this year as well. They check so many boxes including having their own hardware and selling fiat GC&#39;s at Target. SpaceKids is also going to be cook or digital concert tickets.,,,

"I&lt;totally agree with what you are saying.  I started in crypto in August 2017, and I bought in.  I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85% during the ensuing 4 year bear market.  I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do.  I wish I had bought more.  I learned a lot about buying when there is fear in the market . I use to get shaken out and panic sell but now I buy more when I see the low prices. I started making gains from trading with help of Frank Martin Ster-ne&#39; guidance and signals.  It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research.!!!",,,
I bet they will not let Dokovic to go into their plot,,,
"TCG world will be the metaverse to be in.  4k graphics, 800sq kilometre land mass,  Get in early, its exploding at the moment.  SAND and MANA have nothing on TCG World, check it out",,,
"I bet all the ETH maxi&#39;s are quiet, secretly now buying land on Pavia. People are so damn impatient. 1 minute they are calling Cardano dead and the next minute they are frothing over it, its quite sad really.",,,
PPPAAAAAVVVVIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,,,
Do you have any videos about TCG World?  That metaverse looks awesome.,,,
How can Walmart trademark applications prosper? All these activities are already being done in many projects.,,,
Oh wow so Cardano actually has 1 project lol great but does it work??? Lol,,,
All. Right.,,,
this guy is too bullish,,,
I mean............ Joe rogan didnt say anything about it though he just looked at it lol that doesnt mean anything about axie infinity. Do you think Joe rogan would ever in a million years play axie out of all the game out here now lol,,,
"60% of that worthless s** pre-sold before reaching the “open market”. Man, you have to love decentralization.",,,
Great Joe Rogan the 1gnorant extremist,,,
Which coins will explode,,,
I hope because Sandbox only goes down since I bought it. (No I didn&#39;t buy during ATH),,,
I can’t wait until this all makes some more sense,,,
Walmart are just protecting their name. I wouldnt look to much into it,,,
The real metaverse will be Everdome. Soon.,,,

Would you participate in a Walmart metaverse? F*** NO! Lol,,,
"&lt;The recent bitcoin correction down from its all-time high has had the market in a panic in the past week. However, not everyone has seen it as a bad omen. The digital asset’s price had gone down below $60,000 causing investors to believe the bear market has arrived. Most investors has been hit the most by panic as sell-offs happened through the space. nevertheless, the correction was bound to happen following the incredible run that bitcoin had. Market corrections are always normal and expected after a bull rally, That is why it is reasonable to ride the bear market with a working strategy from a professionalyst, i have been trading Crypto for less than a month now and I was able to make over 4.3btc with trading with Daniel  Wright. He can be reached on Te le gram @Danielwrightfx.",,,

&lt;I&#39;m new to cryptocurrency and I don&#39;t understand how it really works. Can someone guide me on the right approach to investing and making good profit from cryptocurrency investment?..,,,
"I believe &lt; that the inflation is already priced in crypto market since the end of last year. These manipulative whales are always 2 steps ahead of everybody because they are market makers. I hope I’m wrong and they won’t keep dumping it on retail investors as always. Those who hold the longest will profit the most, I trade and hold profits keep up the great work! and also Benjamin Jackson has been doing a great job reviewing all chart, trade and techniques on BTC which has enhance the growth of my portfolio from 1.7BTC to 8 BTC lately.&lt;You can reach Benjamin on ͲeIєɠɾαmBENJAMINJACKSON",,,
"//Gotta hand it to you Jebb, your content remains on of the best on youtube. The past weeks has not been great for retail especially uponly boys. &gt;&gt;As you can see from the charts in because in case you wondered, we are looking at a 5-fold range bound fractal. This must be the rangiest range I&#39;ve seen in years for Bitcoin. The vast majority of discretionary traders tend to become more and more hopeless as the range box develops. It&#39;s a patience test failed by many. This is a pivotal moment and that&#39;s why the majority will regret. If it goes down, people say: why haven&#39;t I sold If it goes u, people say: why haven&#39;t I bought &gt;&gt;In September 2021 bulls trapped the bears, check the lower wick on 21th of September and now a buy signal has been given which strongly indicates a final bottoming process is locked. One of the scenario&#39;s from career trader Callum Lucas is that bulls will use the same trick, as his automated sig- nals based on unique combinations of trend, momentum and volume scanners supports this thesis. So far I&#39;ve accumulated over 8BTC trading with it. If interested then reach out through Te\ᒪE Gᖇαm callumlucas",,,
I think you do a great job in lack of Jebb so just do your thing :),,,
"&lt;I totally agree with what you are saying....The fact is, BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first. for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish. while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose, others are being patient. it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. i would say trading has been going smoothly for me, i started with 5.5 BTC and i have accumulated over 19.6 BTC in just three weeks, with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Leon Calvin.",,,
"Opinions like yours are very much appreciated. However, we are in extreme different times with many other key factors in play that werent in previous markets..... They! now own the market!!!! yes, read the charts, however, ZOOM OUT and think of the WHY&#39;s, regarding the action of the last weeks and going forward. Everything has changed and will change fast in these months ahead Cant be ignored if advising.I will say we all should prepare for any scenario as the market has always been volatile.I have played safe by putting my assets into active trades,so I don&#39;t feel the price if the declination continues.I have made over 16 btc since early september till date from implementing trades with Signals, insights and infos from Trent Hart. I advise everyone to stick to this method instead of just waiting on a pump",,,
"Love the channel but the intro is kind of annoying now. Maybe shorten it up lol. However up 400% on 140 Sandbox, 150% on 130 Decentraland. Not too bad",,,
"So tired of all the down and sideways movements... All the predictions and &quot;bottom is close&quot; when in reality no one knows.Wake me up when we get back to 60k, in the meantime it&#39;s bad for your mental health if you&#39;re a casual investor who doesn&#39;t have time to study charts/TA all day to check the prices daily lol",,,

"Honnêtement je ne pense pas que le btc ira à 20k car c&#39;est trop obvious. Si un btc ira a 20k tout le monde se jettera dessus y compris le retail lambda, car désormais en 2022 les crypto c&#39;est devenu mainstream et tout le monde attend la fameuse &quot; chute magique &quot; pour pouvoir refill et enfin rentrer dans le train royal des crypto.  Pendant le crash covid 2020 c&#39;était pas pareil, les crypto étaient pas aussi médiatisés, et la chute était un jour de la semaine a 3h du matin ( là où je me suis fait plaisir bien sur )  j&#39;avais cours le lendemain donc difficile pour le golem classique de refill. Fallait vraiment déja connaitre les crypto avant pour avoir pu profiter de cette chute.",,,

A part CM avec tout le respect que j’ai pour ton boulot énorme il faut avouer que le marché crypto n’est pas pour les impatients et surtout pour les trader du dimanche si on veut gagner avec les whales il faut holder les cycles et là à mon sens tout le monde en garderai un magnifique souvenir. Comparez l’évolution de l’or et celle du btc rien à voir ce que a fait btc en 10 ans tandis que l’or a mis je ne sais combien de temps pour se retrouver un investissement trop paresseux ! Donc il y a des beaux jours encore mais pendant quelques semaines il va falloir morfler donc si tu arrives à nous passer quelque vidéos hors sujets pour que tout le monde se relax style comme t’as fait quelque fois avec tes passions musicales vidéos etc ça serait trop top,,,

Thanks Jason,,,
"[ &lt;The cyrpto market has been unstable. People ask themselves if this is the right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first. BTC price fall means analysts remain divided over whether it is entering a bear market or is just suffering a brief correction on the road to more record highs. Investors who bought early are still in profit despite the recent price crash and they also earn by tradlng. I&#39;m still an investor and still I&#39;m winning by applying the same method in every trad e, you can also become a winner today. We should follow the way of earning more regardless of the current market (bulls or bears), which is tradlng. Buy the Dip and Trade...I have made over 15 btc profits not just by buying the dip but implementing tradess with s!gnals supplied by Mr Ethan Lincoln",,,
"If btc is in extended cycle, does that mean the next best market will be really short?",,,

"&lt;Do not panic, the moon is ours the price is amazing for every early investors for those who got in for the first time otherwise it&#39;s just bouncing back to normal price for the rest of us which is good. Those who hold the longest will profit the most, I trade and hold profits keep up the great work! and also you Mr Marcellus Braylon has been doing a great job reviewing all chart, trade and techniques on BTC which has enhance the growth of my portfolio to 19btc lately.",,,
BTC - $21k  COMING!!!,,,
"&lt;The market is very unstable and you can not tell If it&#39;s going bearish or bullish. I advise y&#39;all to forget predictions and start making a good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses.When these reports are bullish take some off to the side lines, when news gets bearish start buying. &quot;Keep it simple simple&quot; that bear/ correction was the best thing that happened me. &lt;But all thanks to Shlomi Gray for his amazing skills for helping me to earn 19 Btc through trading chart. I believe we are in the spring phase...",,,

So since everybody is super bearish it will probably go up?,,,

"We follow the fact, correct once it happens we all can see. The problem is we can’t predict anything form chart. So far no tools are working. Only trend is your best friend. When it’s more than 50% down just buy and wait till it goes up. No chart is needed. All waste of time",,,
,,,
Crossing bearish on monthly MACD isn&#39;t crucial since mamy people /and traders/ (as you have said)arent playing attention to it and breaking 40k doesnt mean were heading into bear market or anything. 30k could be another bottom for bitcoin to bounce from and make its new way up to new ATHs,,,
One of your best vids in a long time! We all like this format so much better than the infomercial FOMO vids you have been doing of late that clearly take you a lot of effort to make.Keep doing this !,,,
Fed. Society crumbling. Stock market is shot. Inflation. No more stimulus. Bitcoin is at 40k I’d just sell and wait for the real bottom,,,
"its true, nobody is talking about this.  so far that I have seen.  I cannot help but wonder why?",,,
"Hi Steve, do you think if BTC dominance falls below 37 on the charts that there will be an ALTCOIN run like there was in early 2018.",,,
"Great info bro, thanks!!!",,,
"The majority of people on CT are bullish? It’s the exact opposite of that. Everyone’s expecting we fall off the cliff here, even without having any significant retrace after 69-39k.

Youtube and ct people saying so much without saying anything at all, and shilling ridiculously expensive programs aren’t the way",,,

Steve is one of the best TA&#39;s in the crypto space. He&#39;s the ONLY one who knew that BTC was sliping into the Gaussian channel to have it&#39;s price dip below 50K.,,,

"Tonga was a controlled hit, look for the videos!",,,
Market has changed... this doesnt mean much. I think we will drop a little bit then go up again. Crypto is not the same when it was 5 years ago,,,
Thanks for concern for Tonga.,,,
Substancial!!! Thoughts to affected people! Thanks a lot!!!,,,
Tell us what your doing Steve. Are you selling or buying?,,,
"Thank you for the video Steve, I always look forward to these as I don&#39;t think you get a better big picture analysis out there. These videos really do help keep the mindset nice and even.Hope the house move went well and kudos for the shout out to Tonga - I have a friend out there and know they&#39;re going through it right now.",,,

"In my opinion, Shiba Inu will become the world currency. Bitcoin will die, it is a billionaires coin and totally controlled by them. Ethereum will get stronger with 2.0 then 3.0 and shiba, once they developed their own block chain they will bridge. At that time they will dominate the gaming , Nft and Defi space in crypto. NFT’s will be dead in less than 2 years. All other coins will die off. All my opinion of course.",,,
what abaut your box theory Steve? you where calling for super cycle and where is it? you pice of shit,,,
Why does my Trading View MACD on the monthly cross in May 2021 and never cross back for the positive?,,,
Thank you Steve!,,,
Thank you Steve great breakdown of the potential future. Glad to hear you made it safe and are settling in. My prayers go out to Tonga and the people that have affected .,,,
"I knew you would deliver, Steve! Great video and insight. My wife&#39;s family was devastated by Typhoon Odette recently in the Philippines. It is heartbreaking. So, my thought is with the Tongans.",,,

"Yes!! I&#39;ve noticed this a month ago and haven&#39;t bought any btc , this is why every pump I start selling  preparing for that dump possibly to a bear market that is due by now . Markets are  to high",,,

Been checking the feed watching for a few Years great TA,,,
Several months of downtrendBTC not looking great for sure but also look at Total Market Cap.It is printing a potential bearish H&amp;S pattern that could bring us down to almost $1 trillion.This would convince me we are officially in multiyear bear market.,,,
"If your viewers follow your &quot;when to sell video&quot; they run the risk of holding through the entire bear market because your indicators were already hit in November. If the MACD crosses and BTC drops 50%, your viewers are going to be stuck waiting for RSI above 70 and the price to get above the 50 day MA. Maybe you should make a quick video explaining that?",,,
"Yes, it is about to die into a bear market, the ship is sinking, dump dump dump it will go down. Nah, just kidding, this is Whales using Bitcoin to manipulate and dump the market. This space will be better when speculation trash coins like BTC lose number 1 spot and real utility tech like Cardano and XRP take over. That will stop manipulation as price action will be based on utility and how well the tech actually functions (having a famous name is not classed as &quot;function well&quot;).",,,
"Level headed, the best words ever . Another thing Steve, what is your gut feeling telling you? It´s like a women´s touch... they always know . Great vid btw",,,
"I think we could see $30k by mid to late March. - by way of a relatively orderly decline. Rally back to $50k by July, then THE  cycle low of $20k in September. Then, $200k+  some time in 2023, maybe mid year, which then marks the cycle top.",,,
Thanks for news.Greate job,,,
Interesting. Thank you,,,
Steve your hair is still bullish,,,
Another great video Steve. Good explanation on the facts,,,
I&#39;ve been waiting for your video.  Thank you so much. The best TA ever!,,,
Great …just great,,,
"The charts are amazing but there is one thing that is 100% accurate, after I sell a large amount of BTC, price goes up, after I buy a large amount of BTC, price goes down, today I am going to sell 1/3 of my BTC, so price will be going up in the next three months.  Your welcome.",,,
Hi Steve. You dumped 3 boxes?,,,

"&lt;.&lt;It&#39;s all going up 2022, Stick with ETH/BTC/SOL/MATIC/MANA/VET/SAND/AVAX/THETA as much as you can guys. If everyone sells when it starts to fall, which at this point its falling, the dream may be lost because of it being too volatile. just remember where it&#39;s going and don&#39;t be put off by short term fluctuations and don&#39;t facilitate this dream into becoming a nightmare. It will always correct to higher until it&#39;s mooned naturally. Don&#39;t give up on it and start day trading it, it will take too much time and concentration. Remember ETH/BNB/SOL/ADA/XRP is probably potential coins. It is quite unfortunate that the most popular word lately amongst crypto enthusiasts and traders alike is “hodl.” This concept of “holding on for dear life” in itself may not be a bad idea but why hold on to an investment instrument which could make you some money, or make you very miserable tomorrow? Making a good profit off crypto is easy if and only if you can find the right entry point and exit point in your day trading. Someone I discovered that has tremendously helped me with this is, Mr. Paulson Dmitriev. He has a system which is so effective it amazes me. I have been using his signals and strategies and have turned out a very impressive profit over the last two months. I would suggest him for beginners and even more experienced traders who have a problem turning in a consistent profit. He can be contacted via Telegram ( @ PaulsonDmitriev ) , and don&#39;t give up the crashing market will bounce back.&gt;///",,,

Amazing video !!,,,
Has less than 24 hours? Yeah right. Keep telling us how great it is……,,,
"In my opinion, Shiba Inu will become the world currency. Bitcoin will die, it is a billionaires coin and totally controlled by them. Ethereum will get stronger with 2.0 then 3.0 and shiba, once they developed their own block chain they will bridge. At that time they will dominate the gaming , Nft and Defi space in crypto. NFT’s will be dead in less than 2 years. All other coins will die off. All my opinion of course.",,,
why does all that sound similar to usual tether or china fud?,,,
Max Kaiser has been more off in his BTC predictions than ANYONE. Why should we continue to listen to him?,,,
Xoloinu will 1000x,,,
"Bitcoin has to go to zero, or the people that own most of it will rule this planet. Imagine putting most of the world’s Gold in the wrong hands. Do you know who owns most of the worlds Bitcoin. Do your homework, you may be very surprised. Their is a shift taking place towards a token that has a good utility and that everyday people can buy and use daily. My opinion.",,,
Polkadot is the only Layer 0.,,,
"Hype cool down, not manipulation",,,
Go crypto,,,
"It’s the S.O.S pattern, 3 long 3 short",,,
"Max keiser had some work done, looks younger",,,
"Looks like it&#39;s going down, not up...",,,
Here &lt;zombie! I wanna further my knowledge on the blockchain. Im really good with analysis and advice as to where can i gain more knowledge as far as topics in the market and blockchain. I learned a lot about buying when there is fear in the market . I use to get shaken out and panic sell but now I buy more when I see the low prices. I started making gains from trading with help of Frank Martin Ster-ne&#39; guidance and signals Thank you zombie,,,
Meme coins and NFTs are killing crypto.  Smart money laughs at this crap and it reflects very poorly on digital assets as a whole.,,,
Love ur videos mate! you&#39;re a great guy! Thanks from AUS,,,
Rubic  (RBC) is a fully functionally layer zero protocol and supports all major chains including Solana and Harmony zero. Soon BTC. 30 mill cap 160 million + in accumulated volume.,,,

I agree 100% that fed will flip flop later and may not raise rates more than twice,,,
Wal-Mart is building on top of Hedera,,,
"Well, it dumped.",,,
What about pond layer 0 also?????,,,
Thank you Brody,,,
"If the FED raises rates by anything substantial, the stock market will crash at least 50%",,,
"You guys are getting brainwashed by this guy . Bitcoin continues to lose market dominance. Eth is actually gaining market dominance , Ada up 10% yesterday. And this guy is predicting 90% bullish for bitcoin. Should not rely fully on chart analysis, this is my point. Chart may be saying it will repeat, but all is not the same outside the chart.",,,
DAG CONSTELLATION LAYER 0 US GOVERNMENT IS BUYING,,,
HODL,,,
Dont buy dogecoin,,,
"Hollywood moved to Washington DC and now occupies total government. They are all actors! Fake government, fake climate change, fake news, fake economy, fake dollar, fake future!",,,
It’s happening right now! The dumpster is reversing to the cliffs edge.,,,
That intro is hilarious! ;D,,,
"when life gives you fiat, buy bitcoin.",,,
Why not rubic finance? Its great for swaping between any chain. They have more chains than anyone other,,,
QNT is also a very interesting project that fixes the interoperability problem,,,
Btw ETH …you have to be a fool to believe in the rip off ..wake up ppl!,,,
What is this lady doing running into a raging bull!?….and she’s not wearing red. It might need to stop listening to these lying analyst all they spread is shit.,,,
"Great video man, would like to hear your take on the possibility of the May-July fractal playing out. Wouldn&#39;t that imply a 41-35k retest before the spring by end of February????",,,
"Intro is on point. I guess if you bought into BTC when it was $50K+ you would be depressed. LOL. As I have said in previous videos (yes a bit of bragging) I bought most of my BTC back in 2015 when it was $240. I also bought ETH in the $300 price range and LTC at the $10 price range. Many other alt coins the same. My entire crypto portfolio is all profit as I have already taken back more than my initial investment. But it&#39;s not all roses and rainbows. I am so mad at myself for not buying more BTC when it was $240. I am even mad at myself for not buying more when it was $3000-$8000 and so on. Had I taken a little more risk in 2015 I would be a retired Bitcoin millionaire right now. But no...I am still working. But I was able to utilize some of my profit to buy my house and I still have a decent &quot;nest egg&quot; for the future. But damn....if only I would have put $5,000 into Bitcoin in 2015. Uggggggg! LOL",,,
to the moon!!!,,,
Why would anyone want to hold fiat? Gross.,,,
35k,,,

Lmao that intro,,,
Symbiosis website looks like a piece of sh*t. Who wants to invest in something so crappy looking,,,
DROOOOOP!!!,,,
"Got to admit, been watching these videos for a long time. Don’t see how all the fundamentals are so good yet nothings happed for 12 months.",,,
For the first time in our lifetimes Bitcoin is neither in bear nor bull but in a long-term sideways market. Remember who told you first.,,,
"Great work, great content as always",,,
It already started dumping. Way to much manipulation BTC could have a bull flag a descending wedge w pattern cup and handle  all in one and still break more to the downside right now,,,
Super video my Brother and Im waiting for the BTC dump to buy SIS … when I commented last it had popped and was at around 2.20 and it was still cheap … dang but really does look good and has a unique use case definitely :)) love your content and be well Broooskii :))) LLAP,,,

aaaaaaannnnd it&#39;s gone,,,
"I love your videos bro they are just a bit to long for me thats why I stick to other youtubers. About 15minutes is perfect for me and I think most people if you want to grow your channel. (Look at altcoin daily they have very poor TA and short term knowledge but all daily updates are around 10min, that why they grew so big.",,,

By chance alone these three are pretty much the only ones I don&#39;t have,,,
Everybody here loves you man..,,,
"Actually Cardano(yeah yeah, I knoow) became nº 5, so 3/5 coins are decentralized",,,
Monero ticks all of your crypto requirements boxes yet you never mention it.,,,
That Solana is in the top 5 shows how truly insane this space is... Clowns,,,
great you&#39;re back bro. Hope you are full strength again,,,
"Hey Chico, you have a backup of your video library right?   When and IF  Binance and Tether play a key role in bringing BTC and much of crypto down 70% this year,the powers that be might also delete your channel and your library content as well.",,,
"Tether is backed by Bitcoin,,,,, Bitcoin is backed by Tether.. Simple,,,,,   Corrupt, but simple.....",,,
"Btw your argument for binance is irrelevantm of course binance is centralized. For now, how else would you onramp fiat into crypto, like CZ said.",,,
Pace yourself with the videos bro. You don&#39;t need to make one everyday or every week at that. Keep your mental health in check bro ease up off making vids every day. Go easy on yourself.,,,
"Bad news about tether? As long as the price is stable, I&#39;m not interested in it.",,,
"BTC 16% higher in a year, solana 3500% higher in a year. A &quot;subtle&quot; difference.",,,
Exposed!!! Nice one Loco Chico...,,,
"In my opinion, Shiba Inu will become the world currency. Bitcoin will die, it is a billionaires coin and totally controlled by them. Ethereum will get stronger with 2.0 then 3.0 and shiba, once they developed their own block chain they will bridge. At that time they will dominate the gaming , Nft and Defi space in crypto. NFT’s will be dead in less than 2 years. All other coins will die off. All my opinion of course.",,,
Best content on the tubes Tyler! I&#39;m a big DOT fan and I worry about centralization there too. When you&#39;ve got those big wallets you can really manipulate markets.,,,
What are the defi ones you recommend ??,,,
Telling everyone SOL is CentFi AF,,,
People still use thether and binance????!!!!,,,
"Now, go and post a comment on Invest Answers channel about any negative views regarding Solana. It won&#39;t be posted for public view. James (who shills Sol in every upload)  blocks any negative posts. Some YouTubers are blocking any comments which disagree with the narrative. Solana will drop like a brick in 2022 once enough people realise what it can and can&#39;t do.",,,
CHICO DXY TO THE MOON ! SORRY,,,
"LMAO! ETH is not decentralized, you will soon find that out........",,,
Congratulations  glad to have you back producing these extraordinary videos full of useful value!  Keep up your good work!! Thank you Chico!,,,
and what about luna?,,,
tether never said its decentralized...,,,
People&#39;s ignorance on centralized and decentralized is just bafflingBe being decentralized is what took those all about.,,,
"we cant do anything about that unfortunately,money is speaking",,,
Thx for your information i am selling my solana. Its getting so much more diffucult to inform yourself with the right information,,,
"there&#39;s an error with binance&#39;s chager to ethereum almost x6, i made a video",,,
There needs to be a podcast debate on Solana between Chico and Investanswers - make it happen.,,,
"If you love Cardano you’re gonna love this coin as it’s not just talking about what they potentially can do. They are already doing it . NEO will have an amazing year in 2022 . Nothing else compares. Any developer can develop on it in any language. Has NFT’s , smart contracts , up to 50k tps. Extremely secure established trusted network. Beats everything hands down. Doesn’t have billions of coins on market like Cardano etc. so has exponential growth ahead. Is very aligned to regulation also and is green friendly and has very low fees.",,,
Top class,,,
Chico keepin it real and dropping knowledge! My man thank you for what you do!!!,,,
"KLIMAAA DAAOOO your pick , very very wrong",,,
Now this is what I call good content!,,,
"I&lt;totally agree with what you are saying.  I started in crypto in August 2017, and I bought in.  I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85% during the ensuing 4 year bear market.  I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do.  I wish I had bought more.  I learned a lot about buying when there is fear in the market . I use to get shaken out and panic sell but now I buy more when I see the low prices. I started making gains from trading with help of Frank Martin Ster-ne&#39; guidance and signals.  It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research.!!!",,,
EXCELLENT VIDEO,,,
Chico when are you going to cover information from cosmos ecosystem?,,,
truthsayer,,,
I didn’t get the alert for this video.  YouTube sucks.,,,
Thanks for coming back Chico,,,
"Real research, real facts, every time. Top Man Chico!!",,,
"Thanks Tylor, you are really a pro with your research! thanks for your always hard work! your the best in the youtube with crypto research! cheers. beat",,,
How about terra luna ...why not in this list ...,,,
Thanks Tyler! Back to your war room. Good to have you back,,,
Tell us you don&#39;t know how blockchain zipf distribution works without telling us lol!,,,
I have a TETHER audit downloaded on my phone...,,,
"Still waiting on feedback whether Chico is still (tree, tree)? Any update on what currently is happening there? Cheers :)",,,
You need to research POSA. You will realize more validators = slower network. The question isn’t about Decentralizing or how centralized it is. Its about having a decent onchain validation speed process to allow for mass liquidity to enter in and out of the binance ecosystem. Why is binance number 1?  You need a blockchain architect in your team to provide insight.,,,
Solana is an absolute centralized shit coin fully backed and participated by VC&#39;S.. Network is down more than up,,,
Chico dropping the GTFO bomb aha,,,
hype gone these coins are finished,,,
Great research.,,,
"Super, possible samedi vidéo on ethereum POS ?",,,
Just a vitalik fan boi make a fud for bsc shitcoiners,,,
Everyone we have another dip today. Let&#39;s buy it tho,,,
Chico! This is why we love you! You are SOooooooo correct. Thanks for keeping my eyes open-er :P  !!!!,,,
"Tyler , you are the most annoying crypto youtuber … 2000 youtubers  out there and all I watch is you .. why your so smart . When Kadena video ?",,,
Hey bro .. hope h are doing great! Just wondering if u know any updates on EWT for 2022,,,
Love that intro song,,,
Always bringing that REAL REAL!!! Fucking Legend!,,,
Thanks Chico. So many players do not understand the need for decentralisation or believe their chains are decentralisation. Much needed.,,,
"Cz, although there have been worse front me.. is basically a CCP shill. Binance will eventually be the CCPs &#39;free decentralised&#39; network.",,,
Amazing content !,,,
"what’s up with Klima, Chico?",,,
"Yeah Detective Tyler Chico back on the scene : DGreat to see to your smile again and you are also looking already a bit more healthy already, especially around the eyes : DVape more weed, stop combustion if you still are burning and get as much sun as possibru! ^_^One Love!Always forward, never ever backward!!&lt;3",,,
Time to take out Charles with your ankle lock Tyler  get rid of that Ada  coin chatter,,,
XRP Decentralized,,,
"Peel them off Chico! Thanks for giving us these information, its valuable to us. Hope you continue doung these things.",,,
"Chico what do you recommend. I hate holding tether but it’s a must use on most platforms, such as Kucoin but orders need tether to be used. It’s like a waiting game to pray my orders go through before tether implodes.",,,
Chico!!,,,
decentralize or gtfo! :D,,,
"Big money disagrees with you on Solana. Let&#39;s imagine Solana had the same amount of adoption that Ethereum has... Do you seriously think it&#39;d be as &quot;centralized&quot; as it is today? Of course not. It&#39;d likely be around the level of decentralization as Ethereum...! ALL PROJECTS START CENTRALIZED, AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM ONLY CONTINUE TO BE FURTHER DECENTRALIZED AS THEY GROW.Stop.",,,
No sir - number 5 does NOT have decentralization issues. That&#39;s because it&#39;s not Solana :),,,
best video,,,
ITS TIME!,,,
im going back to mcd&#39;s arnt I,,,
Hope Solana crashes to zero and destroys all those Wall Street wankers,,,
evergreen video. eth competitor. lol there is only one ETH.,,,
These currencies have problems only because of such custom reviews. I have been using Tether for a long time and I have never had any doubts about this coin.,,,
"Yeah, you my man Chico.",,,
Chico is the best!,,,
For these very reasons I&#39;ll sell nearly all of my SOL when the beta terminates. I&#39;ll swap it all for $ADA when the time comes!,,,
DIGIBYTE IS THE FUTURE!!!!!!!!!!,,,
UST vs USDT,,,

"&lt;The recent bitcoin correction down from its all-time high has had the market in a panic in the past week. However, not everyone has seen it as a bad omen. The digital asset’s price had gone down below $60,000 causing investors to believe the bear market has arrived. Most investors has been hit the most by panic as sell-offs happened through the space. nevertheless, the correction was bound to happen following the incredible run that bitcoin had. Market corrections are always normal and expected after a bull rally, that is why it is reasonable to ride the bear market with a working strategy from a professionalyst, i have been trading Crypto for less than a month now and I was able to make over 4.3btc with trading with Daniel  Wright. He can be reached on Te le gram @Danielwrightfx.",,,

I&#39;ve been watching you guys for about two years and really confused at how non-informative your breakdown of Ecomi was. I will go as far to say a disservice to your viewers really.

"&lt;I have been trading for about 6 months now and just about every trade slaps me in my face. Nearly impossible for me to catch more than a few points  . I try to do top down analysis and MTF analysis, but it doesn&#39;t work for me . I say to myself, clearly I&#39;m in the 90% that lose money, so I open a demo account, do my analysis, then take the opposite of what I would normally take(I know, it sounds stupid but I was desperate) and get the same result. I&#39;m starting to feel hopeless, any advice for a struggling trader?&gt;",,,

Nice info as always. Thanks for sharing,,,
Another great video. Thank you! Let&#39;s hope that next week we have seen the market pump...,,,
When do you make a new video about RSR? Thanks are happening,,,
"I&lt;totally agree with what you are saying.  I started in crypto in August 2017, and I bought in.  I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85% during the ensuing 4 year bear market.  I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do.  I wish I had bought more.  I learned a lot about buying when there is fear in the market . I use to get shaken out and panic sell but now I buy more when I see the low prices. I started making gains from trading with help of Frank Martin Ster-ne&#39; guidance and signals.  It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research.!!!",,,

Would companies accepting crypto payments more and more... mean something like Stellar possibly mooning. Or could this just mean future for (centralized) stable coins?,,,

Guys make your own research on sundaeswap launch. It might suffer from congestion and transaction could take up to days. This will likely be solved by the hydra project in the following month but be aware of potential fud and hence price drop over cardano which will be a great buying opportunity,,,

"great post Very detailed and accurate video that you posted, buddy, I love your content. It&#39;s funny how some people out there still haven&#39;t accepted that crypto currencies continue to change the world globally. It&#39;s hard these days for anyone who is against it. What I feel from a trader&#39;s perspective that we really need more experts in the field to educate newbie’s / investors on how the community works, the price of BTC has been fluctuating lately which means the market is currently open and you are not Be able to tell whether it is going to be too bearish or bullish, this uncertainty pushes most traders away and forces investors to hold on. I would say it is completely wrong to just sit back and wait for a few losses is perhaps the wrong mindset for an investor because, as an investor, you will find ways to keep getting and topping up more and more coins should be our top priority, to make a profit. It all depends on the pattern you are trading in and the source of your strategies as well. I started with 0.2 BTC and have accumulated over 4.5 BTC in just 3 weeks, with the correct trading strategy given to me by an experienced trader, Mr. Edward Rowe. His methods are top notch and profitable and he can easily be contacted via Telegram: @EdwardRowe",,,

Its scary to think NBC is spreading anti pharmaceutical company propaganda. Pfizer is full of scientists and doctors who all trust the science. I am 100% sure they did not make any mistakes and I will not believe that they made a mistake that can even have a sliver of detriment to the patients that they care for throughout the world and time. Please remove this video it is spreading distrust.,,,

Huh interesting dr did you hear the same video you are been featured on ? You said if its 10 micro grans it should be fine but they said they got less than 6 so who is right an its the the shortness of staff huh ok who created that shortness was it uncle Joe with he&#39;s mandate an yesterday&#39;s heroes turn into today&#39;s hated just because they want to follow the my dobdy my choice point but no huh  an now its the staff mistake huh is there no one in charge ??? Where fauci an walenski or zeins the coordinator since he never testifies in front of congress  wonder why but no worries you can juts say like the fbi people just said to Mr Cruz quote sorry I can&#39;t answer that question,,,

It&#39;s ok. With the full dose you still aren&#39;t protected from the virus.,,,

Soo they were purposely short rationing a vaccine to generate profits.  gotcha.  who&#39;s your business insurance carrier?,,,
no worry the  Pfizer COVID-19 shot doesn&#39;t protect anything,,,
And the irony is that a higher dosage wouldn&#39;t have vaccinated them either.,,,
Okay.,,,
I thought a jab was a jab?? So what if you give TOO MUCH???,,,
Only 20 more shots!,,,
What the first draft of the press release said: &quot;Some people may have gotten a lower than recommended dose of this vaccine but it really doesn&#39;t matter. With the public realizing those &quot;rare breakthrough cases&quot; are not rare at all it seems like you  have as much chance of getting Omicron if you are vaccinated or not. Have a nice day.&quot; LOL!,,,

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHH!!!!!,,,
Just know I won&#39;t be taking the first or the fourth.Scam,,,
It’s a shame there’s not a booster for common sense. There’s a lot of fearful zombies out there that think that fake news and govt care about them that could really use that shot right about now.,,,

I’m 19 years old, my sister is 16, she’s my only surviving sibling and family. We lost our parents in the space of 7 months in 2017 and ever since then our lives crumbled. Even if my whole body is filled with mouths it still won’t be enough to describe the level of hardship we’ve endured. We barely eat these days, I can’t even remember the last time we had a really good meal, it breaks my heart to see my little sister cry for food and I can’t help, I had a petty job that used to help put food on our table but I lost the job Bcs I refused to sleep with the monster I was working for who was constantly molesting me. I know it’s wrong to do this, This plea is from a place of utmost sincerity, my sister and I need to eat, I need little financial assistance so I can go to the local markets and buy some groceries (food items) that will keep us alive even if it’s just for a short while, I’ll be forever grateful, If you’ve ever been in a difficult place where you didn’t know where your next meal would come from, Please come to our rescue, Nothing is too small, Nothing is too big to help .

"It is a natural way to control the over inflammation, it may sound weird but it is a cure. Stay at home during covid infection and follow this thing strictly for fifteen days. I make you sure that covid 19 will never be fatal to anyone , It is my life time experience of pneumonia and inflammation. I often faced pneumonia  severely, earlier if I would have had a little scratch on my body it did become a huge wound within some days and it did take months to get it  treated. I have suffered the hellish pain of pneumonia and inflammation through out my life. When antibiotics stopped working I followed this tip very strictly and it&#39;s been two years, I  won&#39;t face neither pneumonia nor inflammation, I have a very sensitive body and if I eat a tiny thing that is a little inflammatory, my body immediately acts upon  that, if I eat two or three pieces of bread I got a body ache, if I eat an orange I got sneezing immediately and if I eat a vegetable or a root , it takes me two to three days but my body tells me that it was inflammatory too, consumption of a garlic clove continuesly for three or four days makes me sick, if I eat an onion or some ginger contained foods continuesly for two or three days I got the same result. Having a so sensitive body I eat a lemon daily,   and it doesn&#39;t affect me any way. I can eat sour curd and, it does no harm to me, but I can not eat an apple or an orange . Pneumonia made my body too sensitive so have differentiated these inflammatory and anti-inflammatory foods  and, I have been working on this theory for a long time, it took me more than 20 years to sort out these foods . Apply the following diet plan strictly for some days during covid 19 infection and you have no fear of any type of pneumonia and inflammation. If this thing is followed strictly, I make you sure on it that covid 19 or it&#39;s variants will never be fatal  for anyone, the doctors will never recommend you this thing because they do not know. A human body takes 15 days to produce antibodies against any virus and it is a natural way to avoid the over inflammation. Non - inflammatory food list 1. All the meaty products [everything, like eggs,  pork, beef, mutton, chicken, fish etc.(eat them  grilled or boiled or you can use pure mustard oil or pure butter clarified to cook them )] . 2. Wheat ( and all the products that are made from pure wheat, not biscuits, cookies or breads because they contain vegetables oil). 3. Gram, cheakpea( chana or kabuli chana). Masoor dal. 5. Green leaves like spinach, lettuce, etc.  ( green leaves mustn&#39;t be sour, bitter or spicy ). 6. All the Dairy products (they must be made from pure animal milk like butter clarified,  curd, cheese, fresh milk ). 7. Pure Mustard oil, turmeric powder, red chili powder , white sugar, sea salt, coriander powder and leaves, butter clarified. 8. Lemon and curd ( lemon and curd are non - inflammatory things  but they act differently with different  foods, with the suggested foods they never be a cause for inflammation). If someone get affected with covid 19, he must avoid lemon for some days because he already would have eaten something that lemon acts as an inflammatory thing. But if the patient would have been  eating  the suggested diet very strictly for more than 18 days then he can add lemon  in his regular diet it will never be inflammatory then. The patient has to apply this diet plan very very strictly because consumption of a single fruit,dry fruit, vegetable or vegetable oil, onion, garlic, ginger and all non suggested cereals , lentils and a little thing besides the suggested diet may affect the whole result, so apply this thing strictly for fifteen days and see the result by yourself. Note- feed your infants with mother milk or pure animal milk,( formula  milk acts like a poison during the covid 19 infection because it contains vegetables oil.(if the patient follows this diet plan strictly his body acts over covid 19 like an animal body does, he may  get affected  but  never faces the worst, and he never be needed to be hospitalized ).(covid 19 is fetal for those patients whose body act overwhelmingly on covid 19, if  someone&#39;s body doesn&#39;t act overwhelmingly he never faces over inflammation  and it&#39;s nothing but a different sort of comman cold for him, if you follow this diet plan your body never act overwhelmingly on covid 19 believe me Our natural immune system is capable to neutralize this virus, but it needs time because a human body does take 15 days to produce antibodies against any virus, and it is not covid 19 that kills the patient directly but it is a cause for death.

Sheba Hospital last month tested a fourth shot given to more than 270 medical workers, with 154 getting the Pfizer jab and 120 receiving Moderna.&quot;&quot;While the list of potential symptoms related to Omicron infections is the same, limited data suggests that a few symptoms — chiefly fatigue, feeling overtired or exhausted and pain across multiple muscle groups on the body — are much more common than breathlessness or a loss of taste and smell associated with previous strains of the coronavirus.unpopular opinion: &quot;Talk to a family doctor regarding vaccines if you need one or not; depending on your age and health&quot;according to online data, these vaccines AKA TINCTURES are NOT  FDA approved and still requires several dozens of years to research to coincide with current protection information.Youre not ANTI-VAX if you had shots as a kid, just ANTI new AGE DRUG THERAPY if anything. people cannot say you&#39;re anti-vax if you had vaccinations, period.also now only N95 masks protect individuals and people have been using the wrong mask for months.HYGIENIC PEOPLE who follow OSHA health protocols should never get sick knock on wood its OTHER PEOPLE who are spreading it to vaccinated and unvaccinated;   all together.also now hospitals are allowing a-symptomatic staff back to work to help patients who may NOT BE EXPOSED to these viruses clearly PUBLIC INTERESTS are becoming a PUBLIC HEALTH LIABILITYwake up america.",,,
To hell with all these vaccines !,,,
A fourth dose just proves one thing to me. The other 3 failed,,,

Soon you&#39;&#39;ll need a 6th dose to protect you from the first 5 doses,,,

What to know? It does nothing like the other 3.... More snake oil sales at 5 cya then!,,,
Lets go Brandon,,,
I’ve gotten a booster every week since omicron started. I can’t feel my right arm anymore but I won’t get covid.,,,
Never get the vaxx,,,
I am done if you say we need a 4 th dose.,,,
"if the 2nd booster is not needed, why 1st booster is needed?",,,
I&#39;m so SICK of people pretending their opinion is &quot;THE SCIENCE&quot;.This has become a clown show! I&#39;m so happy to be fully UNVACCINATED,,,
I&#39;d  to see the dislike ratio,,,
I realized that  the secert to making a million  Is saving  for a better  investment.I always  tell myself you don&#39;t need that new maserati or that vacation just  yet. That mindset helped me make more money investing.for example last year I invested 80k in stock/crypto (with the help of my financial  advisor Blake Claus ) and made about 268k ever since then he has been delivering.,,,

"Minor correction about the Chilean vaccine campaign: The government bought dosis from lots of different places (pfzier, astrazenica, sinvac...) , the majority of dosis initially available were from one of the Chinese labs, but some groups still got pfizer dosis amongst the first people to get vaccinated (mainly medical staff, the police and workers in public facing roles such as banks and schools).",,,

Israel the occupier Got 4 Vaccine shot  while  Palestinian got maybe 1.. free palestine.,,,
P.S the 4th shot is ineffective against omicron,,,
Research shows that stomping on human head with a military boot will stop the spread of covid,,,
oh gosh dont tell me we should get a vaccine every few months for the rest of our lives :/ this wouldnt make sense,,,
"So expiry time for each shot is 6 months. New variant comes every 6 months , if keep on taking boosters or vaccine frequently, it will damange the immune system! So what’s the point here?",,,

The cost of making one dose of Pfizer is one dollar, they sell it for around thirty dollars. I&#39;m double vaccinated, no way I&#39;m getting that third dose. I will trust them what they say one year ago, double dose protects us 95%. Show the real data, not Pfizer data.",,,
No,,,
Why don&#39;t we give the rest of our vaccines to vaccine poor countries? Ya&#39;know protect ALL of us.,,,
Why were memory B cells not mentioned here.  You’re memory B cells should remember the antigenic site and produce more antibodies when exposed to the virus.,,,
To many boosters is stoopid. Now  all the government must divert their vaccine supply to countries that don’t have enough vaccine to protect their people &amp; countries that has a low vaccine rate. P.s the only way a virus can mutate and live  is through a living host e.g like us humans. Since most countries have herd immunity from states to states. Now it’s time for us to focus on Global immunity so that the virus can’t mutate rapidly. OrCreate a new advance vaccine that can adapt to new COVID variant without needing another booster shotPLEASE DO CORRECT ME IF I SAID ANYTHING WORNG.  thank you,,,

If these companies can make vaccine then they can create a virus too.Those companies are making billions from this pandemic.certainly 4th booster won&#39;t be last shot many more would come.,,,
"Boosters are great,We need more Boosters",,,
Just keep taking booster shots every six months for the rest of your life if you are that scared. I believe the virus will run its corse no matter what we humans do,,,

"Sotomayor really seems to show her colors.  Housing project &quot;inner city&quot;. child of foreign-born catholic uneducated working class parents (her father dropped out of school in 3rd grade). She was not English fluent until age 10.  While her ambition is truly commendable, one also wonders how hungry she must have been, how easily influenced, how easily controlled, how malleable, how utterly useful.   This is why &quot;scholarship students&quot; are so often put forward.   From the get-go they are out of their depth and easily used, also hungry enough not to realize this about themselves.  Many die never having realized how they were used.    They simply see themselves as a great success.     The constitution was an expression of a very different (even antithetical) culture, the wasp culture of the 1700s.   It&#39;s language, ideas, values, expression, were actually, in part, devised so that people such as Sotomayor could never rule over &quot;our posterity,&quot;    We are taught, ad nauseam, that one group cannot speak for another, so how could someone so foreign to the most core American document ever truly hope to interpret it?    To understand it in any way vaguely connected to the people to whom it most belongs (to those who are from the same culture, language, religion, historical narrative, historical reality, as the founders?   Who fought with them in the same founding war?).     Can anyone really transcend their own reality (language, history, shared narrative, religion, arts, etc), to the point that he or she is the best spokesperson for a foreign people?    Isn&#39;t THAT colonialism?       She begs the question.    So, isn&#39;t she a &#39;Neo-colonist?&quot;   A light bearer emmigrated from another culture recently arrived in the country to explain to  Americans what their own (real) ancestors were saying.250 years ago?  It&#39;s all kind of interesting to watch.    Figures such as Soto mayor really do  prove what the leftist taught in the colleges, that people from other cultures really can never fully &quot;assimilate.&quot;   This is especially true if they do not even have any influence from the culture, such as is the case with her, having spent no significant time being influenced by and exposed to generational American culture.   How many generational Americans do you think she&#39;s even met?    How comfortable will parents be if told to vaccinate infants by a women who was left childless after a very brief, failed marriage?   It all seems to beg the question:   who should we most listen to?  why?    who are they, really?    who will have our best interests at heart?     Often, I have heard people claim that American &quot;always had failure written upon it,&quot; due to the heresies of the protestants who created it, due to their attachment to freedoms that have now gone too far.     Yet, &quot;the founding stock&quot; are virtually nowhere to be found (not one on he Supreme Court, few in government, virtually absolutely none in media, and so on).     It seems much more likely that the WW II immigration  influx and jewish-catholic alliance since WWII, has had play.   This is the makeup of the court now.    Just as Sotomayor, these are the people who have been visibly in control for the past 60 years (not the generational Americans).   To me, those Americans are a very interesting group,     I can&#39;t help but wonder what they will do, where their future lies, how they will regroup, who they will be allies with, where they will go, if they will make another world in another place.",,,

There aren’t liberal or conservative treatment modalities when it comes to treating illness.  Every illness has a specific regimen and treatment plan.  This reminds me of AIDS in the early eighties.  Many gay men did not trust the medical community and started treating themselves with high doses of penicillin. Well you see how far that got?,,,
Cha&#39;alt!,,,
Also thank you to the news Channel for reporting truth,,,
"This is ambition, watch her behavior over time.",,,
"&quot;Lies&quot; are not &quot;views&quot;. If she claimed that leaches could be used to treat covid, she would be just as wrong. She&#39;s wrong, should know better, and put lives at risk. She deserves to be fired.",,,
"A little poem to darken your day and open your eyes.MASKS DONT WORK AT AII… NOT IN SCHOOLS, NOT IN POOLS… NOT IN THE SHOWER, NOT AT ANY HOUR… NOT IN THE BAR… AND CERTAINLY NOT, WHILE DRIVING, ALONE IN YOUR CAR… THEY DON’T WORK IN YOUR BED… ITS ALL IN YOUR HEAD. PLEASE HEED WHAT I’VE SAID….

"It&#39;s unproven, so the hospital has to protect itself against potential lawsuit from patients.  She can still prescribe it from her own practice and take the same risk. This is no more than someone funding her for political reason, and she&#39;s just a pawn.",,,
It is disgusting and Evil that Dr. Boden got fired for speaking the Truth and trying to do the Right Thing.  Dr. Boden is a True Hero.,,,
Private business can make their own policies as long as it does not discriminate as stated in law and last time I checked medical opinions does not fall under that law. Good luck on her longshot lawsuit. It will be very difficult to prove her opinion when the CDC and medical establishment doesn&#39;t agree with her.,,,
The main reason they fight it so hard is if there are any alternative ways to treat covid than an EUA cannot be approved for the vaccine. Thats why the shot is the only pushed option.,,,
I feel sorry for the people that think the covid vaccine is answer now they are talking about a 4th shot? The amount of money being made is crazy Also ivermectin is already used for treatment in other countries so theres that,,,
lol and she and her minions aren&#39;t even wearing masks.,,,
Love how nobody is wearing a mask at the presser.,,,
"If she has treated 2,000 patients, I would think her experience would be appreciated and invaluable. It’s very telling that the only remedy the leftists and those that follow their lead is the vaccine that doesn’t seem to prevent anything. The vaccine is being used as their vehicle for violating all sorts of rights of the people.",,,
About time somebody started to say something about these hospitals. They are part of the problem going along with the big pharma plan.,,,
"@ 2:09... The nurse with the dark hair standing behind her, I&#39;m a little under the weather... Do you make house calls beautiful?",,,
About time,,,
"Prayers for you, thank you for telling truth",,,
"I love that all the docs behind her are karens, herself included",,,
"These are the kind of doctors are called quakes or the docs who prescribe snake oil medicine. There are hundreds of randomized published articles not just in USA, but around the world including India which is Pharmacy of the world showing ineffectiveness of Ivermectin, an anti parasitic drug.  Public, please be-aware. I am not telling Vaccines and masks are effective 100% but there is substantial evidence.",,,
I&#39;m so glad she is standing up to this ridiculous hospital!!! EARLY TREATMENT is the way to save lives!!   These hospitals are getting top dollar for every person positive for covid!  That surely is a conflict of interest!,,,
"Well, if they receive Medicare or Medicade funding, it&#39;s a requirement.",,,
So great where is HER PEER reviewed DATA showing Ivermectin works.. I want to see EVERYONES data,,,
Sure hope she loses.,,,
covid-19 info is wrong but this AD for &#39;ancient vietnamese fat burning hack&#39; is Ay Okay.,,,
"Vaccine in body bad, anti-parasitic in body good?  Me no understand.",,,
"I have to wonder....why are the powers to be at Methodist so afraid of professionals with a different opinion?  Come on....the so called &quot;science&quot; around effectiveness of vaccines, how it spreads, ways to prevent it, ect. all keeps changing.  We have a vast set of data we could look at around the wearing of masks and how effective is it.  Compare the rates of covid in Texas and Florida (no mask mandates) to the rates in New York and California (strict mask mandates).  If the masks were effective, then the rates in California and New York should be much much lower than Texas and Florida.  They are not.",,,
it works!!,,,
"A doctor who prescribes antiworming medicine  for Covid is hilarious. So she must think she is a virologist, what an idiot.",,,
Hospitals are banning doctor&#39;s hospital rights for filing VAERS reports on covid vaccine side effects. That is just wrong.,,,

We Need Doctors to be able to work together ask questions put their heads together share Ideas  so they can find cures and answer&#39;s  the politicians need to get the hell out of their way and let them do their jobs that they trained for this is not a game stop messing with our health and our lives start telling the truth or go to jail .,,,
"Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine both help fight the infection. They&#39;re not 100% effective, but they help some - so why not take them?   I would if I was sick.",,,

"Doctors should decide treatment, not policy-hacks.",,,
This virus is man made &quot;allegedly&quot; and it did what it was exactly supposed to do population control,,,
"we need more doctors to remember that they are in medicine to help and heal and learn. that started by humans asking questions to help gain knowledge and testing new, or alternative methods in medicine. if they wouldnt have we would still be rubbing piss mud on the wound and doing a dance to appease the gods. so why punish the good ones and reward the drones? it literally makes no sense. i have an idea, try to make this experimental drug mandatory for business and travel and then when they still get sick, lets keep putting people on ventilators cuz that works so well. and if you dont agree your a right wing radical racist.....",,,

when you can&#39;t question science then its merely propaganda.......,,,
we need more doctors like her!,,,
"Finally ,",,,

Exelente Doctor,,,
ENT doc treating COVID.   seriously!  This is completely crazy.  obviously the ugly intersection of politics and medicine.   She will loose.....,,,
Good for her. Thanks Doc,,,
bound to fail- she is free not to get the vaccine but they are free to not keep people on staff,,,
Good. As she should. Indian BAR is suing WHO for dissing them over using ivermectin.,,,
Let&#39;s be CLEAR: This doctor is an American Hero! I&#39;ve heard so many doctors say exactly the same thing as her about Ivermectin &amp; HCQ! The UGLY TRUTH is Big Pharma is not allowed to push an emergency vaccine if there is effective treatment available. So corrupt!,,,
"Medical providers are not the ones who decide what is good medical practice or what medications are safe and effective.   That is the job of researchers who do the extensive studies, testing, and data collecting.   What she is qualified to do, and what she should only be doing, is providing the medical treatments that are proven to be safe and effective by the researchers.  She can disagree in her mind, but not in the medical treatments she provides.  If she is so sure about being correct, then she needs to become a researcher, publish her findings in the appropriate medical journals, and let the medical research community reach a consensus about the validity of her research.",,,
I hear tomorrow on 1-19 (911 backwards) they will be turning up the 5G. What was that zombie preparedness plan for??,,,
"In some countries, if you have COVID, they tell you to fight it at home. Their hospitals don&#39;t have the privilege to balance anti-vaxxers and people with real medical concerns.",,,
Please fire this quack pull her license!,,,
"Notice how this no longer practicing doctor is surrounded by techs and nurses too uneducated to even give an informed opinion on the matter. Then notice that there&#39;s no other doctors supporting her at her scheduled press conference. Mary Bowden was not fired for utilizing Ivermectin. She was fired for stupid Twitter rants like declaring this a &quot;pandemic of the vaccinated&quot; and &quot;no medically necessary reason to be vaccinated&quot;. She&#39;s a moron, with little support from her peers, tricking vaccine sceptics into paying her.",,,
"Don&#39;t forget the $25,000.00 cash the government gives the hospital for every covid-19 patient on a respirator,my grandson broke his arm,we went in the hospital to get a cast,they said he has covid-19 and they wanted to put him on a respirator,i said NO! ...we went home....",,,
She is a roll model sticking up to the tyranny,,,
I&#39;m torn on a like or thumbs down.. .. its good they reported on it... but showed misinformation...,,,
Currently available data do not show ivermectin is effective against COVID-19. Clinical trials assessing ivermectin tablets for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in people are ongoing. This has not been approved by the FDA and the Doctor should be fired,,,
People...remember Youtube is censoring...they are owned by Google...we are not getting free speech.  We are being censored.,,,
"By definition, from any medical institution in the world, a vaccine is described as a medication that creates immunity against the disease it was designed to protect you from. Not one human being on planet earth has been made immune to covid 19 or its varients by being poisoned by any of the shots being offered. Why then are so many jackasses in the medical field, the gov&#39;ts  around the world and the manufacturers of these poison shots calling them vaccines?!?! I&#39;ll tell you why....money and greed!!! At the expense of millions of human lives!!!",,,
I hope she wins...from an ER nurse!,,,
Revoke her medical license.,,,
Thank goodness we have Medical Doctors out there that have a spine,,,
Did you see the nurse over her right shoulder?  .....hot.,,,
even doctors arent immune to trumpism.,,,
The whole thing&#39;s just about over it was a test.  They found out who would comply who would not and who would carry their water.,,,
Bravo &#39; as it should be . The truth will set you free . I like this lady Dr. I&#39;m out !,,,
It should be all about saving patients.  Good for you Doc!,,,
"She should probably lose here license over this. Ivermectin is being studied and used all over the globe. If it was a viable treatment there&#39;d be no pandemic. We don&#39;t have to listen to either side, the math tells us the truth. Her personal experiences are just that. Nobody ever claims science is fair and the biggest lie here is that she hasn&#39;t lost any patients. That is lying by omission because she cared for patients who died from covid, they just weren&#39;t patients of her practice. She is also lying because the hospital never said to stop using Ivermectin, they just want to push the vaccines because they do work. So she is propping up the drug and knocking vaccines and that&#39;s what got her suspended. She is not their spokesperson and her grandstanding is not in line with their policies. Hospitals can ill afford to have quacks speaking for them or even being confused as someone speaking for them. So she is clearly politically motivated because if the patients were all she cared about she would continue to help people and not get involved with the debates.If she can cure covid with Ivermectin, all she needs is a lemonade stand and the world will line up and the pandemic would be over. It won&#39;t happen because she can&#39;t do it, because it won&#39;t work, because others are trying and failing as we speak and people are dying without the chance of better, more proven practices. Unfortunately you cannot stop everyone from dying, but the tried and true approach people are taking all around the world are all in line with each other and countries without a vaccine or too poor for the vaccine are begging for it. So yea, we need to start yanking licenses because 16k MDs worldwide is not even .01% of the world&#39;s population of MDs...",,,

"I literally sat with a doctor just last week who said the exact opposite. According to WebMD, only 3% of Doctors nationwide are currently unvaccinated. There are broken clocks in every field...let&#39;s not give this one any more media time.

We need to stand with these truckers. No more mandating.,,,

After 2 years it&#39;s not happened anywhere, in fact higher the vacc rate cov gets worse (happening in every single country with high vacc rate, after every wave, the infection rate gets much higher and they still push the same failed policy. Why?). If fully vacc-ing a country works so well, how do they explain Gibraltar? 100% vacc rate, nonstop cov crisis! How about cruise liners and some USA navy ships?

Many of us will have friends or family begrudgingly coming back to us as they realize we were right all along. After our many persecutions at the height of big government, big tech, and maybe even our own loved ones, let us now express the moral high ground and extend the hand of love and forgiveness. Not only is it the right thing to do, but by doing so our numbers increase. Resist the urge to rub their faces in it.

I can’t believe people can be so stupid. How are people still watching this crap .,,,
If it does not do what it is indicated to do.  How come it’s still on the market.   It does t state it prevents hospital stays or says it prevents severe disease- THE INDICATION IS TO PREVENT SARS INFECTIONS.    and it does not.    Time to take it off the market and make a vaccine that works because this vaccine doesn’t.   And it weakens the immune system.  Which is THE ONLY THING THAT BEATS COVID.,,,

Yup. We&#39;ve been saying for months that this was going to happen. You will never be considered fully vaccinated and will always be just one missed shot away from being lumped in with the &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; that you have been taught to hate and dehumanize. Enjoy your monthly jabs.,,,

"5:04 &quot;Full Disclosure&quot; Paraphrased  &quot;I potentially spread the virus to people who were vaccinated and unvaccinated, because I didn&#39;t know I had it. I was around people. I just had a runny nose. I owe it to the vaccine, that I  didn&#39;t get severely sick, hospitalized or die. &#39;I hope anyone she exposed to the virus infection,  she didn&#39;t know she had,  was fully vaccinated and boosted so if they became infected they won&#39;t get severely ill, hospitalized, or die. It&#39;s why it&#39;s important to get vaccinated.

There seems to be a new out break every few minutes at some other place that only vaxed people are allowed to go. Im not at the arenas or theaters. Im not eating in the places.

Canadians are so over COVID. Stop the dirty masks  contaminating the counters when standing  injections  six foot distancing lock downs curfews.

"Revelation 9:20-21 KJV – “And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries [hang on to that word, I want to come back to it], nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.”In other words, during the seven-year Tribulation, when the judgment of God, the wrath of God, is poured out on a Christ-rejecting world, we’re told that one-fourth of the population of earth will be killed. One-fourth! Then here, John says of those that were not killed by these plagues, some would still not repent of their “sorceries.” Now, this is an intriguing word.In the original language of the Greek New Testament, the word “sorceries” is translated “pharmakeia” from where we get our English word for “pharmacy/pharmaceuticals.” That seems kind of strange….Well, let’s look at Revelation 18:23; it might fill in a couple of blanks:Revelation 18:23 KJV – “And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants [speaking of Babylon] were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries [there this word is again, “pharmakeia”] were all nations deceived.”Stop right there. In other words, something to do with pharmaceutical sorcery was a deception because, by this, all the nations were deceived.",,,
"Now I know  why God is so angry in Revelation  18:23 that he has mystery Babylon thrown down and burned with fire.Her crime is in this verse it says and by your sorcery ( translated from the original Greek Pharmakeia ,English is pharmaceuticals ) ALL the  nations were deceived.Vaccines are pharma .Mystery Babylon is the controlling entity that rides the beast ( final 10 nations or zones) world empire.God is going to pour out his wrath in a period of time which we are moving into called the tribulation.It’s a 7 year period,the last 3 1/2 years is called the great tribulation where God judges the earth in vengeance .It’s called the time of his wrath and everyone on the planet will know the games up.What we are seeing is the end times evil manifesting itself in an attempt to take over the world and usher in one world government with a leader the scripture calls the son of perdition .It’s the son of the serpent,the devils seed .Christ will return and completely destroy the work of the evil one at the end of the age but for now the wicked are taking temporary control for a short time“and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.”‭‭Revelation‬ ‭18:23‬ ‭",,,

"Damn very disappointing. Kenny talking with the most sense on the panel. Smh @ Shaq n I&#39;m a big supporter but I highly disagree on this one. Injecting something in your body without full knowledge on what it is or isn&#39;t Is far more important than a basketball game on any level.Lastly why y&#39;all so pressed about what this man choose to do with his own body and life. Y&#39;all don&#39;t even advocate for people to stop smoking tobacco, eating terrible foods, and for years cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and etc has been leading causes of deaths. To conclude, who is anyone to determine whether or not in what Kyrie believes is right or wrong. He has his own life to live for him and whether what he believes is &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;right&quot; when it all hits the fan, he is still entitled to believe what he wants just as Shaq, Kenny, Chuck, and Ernie and anyone else in the world. Stop trying to condemn a man for what the hell he &quot;believes&quot;.Most of y&#39;all on the damn panel probably &quot;believe in God&quot; and we know the truth behind that bullshit if u just pick up some damn books and read. Talk about Kyrie and his Profession, not his Personal Decisions and/or beliefs. Y&#39;all starting to sound like bigots over this Covid nonsense. If u wanna take the risk of getting vaccinated then get it, if u don&#39;t, then don&#39;t. Stop worrying about what the next man do and focus on the man in the mirror.",,,

And on top of that he deserves to be consistently and solely bashed by the media? If anyone, the NBA and the organisation should be blamed for so heavily relying on Kyrie Irving even when he&#39;s unfalteringly stated he won&#39;t get vaccinated.",,,

Kyrie stands alone at the top of the mountain of RESPECT. Hey Shak keep making your money and leave the real issues to MEN like Kyrie.,,,
Shaq doesn&#39;t get. It nothing to do with conspiracies. People that don&#39;t get the shot. Have no problem with the vaccine itself. The problem is the politics related to the vaccine. The government should not be trying to force people to get it,,,
Vaccinated people still spread the virus. There&#39;s no advantage to the next man if I get Vaccinated. You guys are following Chuck science not real science.,,,
Don&#39;t be mad at Kyrie get mad at New York for their dumb law.,,,
Kenny is the only one using his brain . Vaccinated or not you can still spread covid . Why does Kyrie need to be vaccinated. Vaccinated players are missing games because of Covid . Not one NBA was hospitalized for Covid prior to the vaccine,,,
Vacina contra o covid não funciona,,,
Deixem o cara em paz com a decisão dele,,,
Shaq sounds stupid,,,
"Kyrie isn’t a leader. While he was away he still got paid. True leaders risks something for the greater good of the people. He’s not doing that. Kyrie got lucky that the Nets started getting injuries and the Nets organization defaulted on their stance and needed him back. There’s people out there not taking the vaccine and risking their jobs and not getting paid. Kyrie found a way to have his cake and eat it too. He’s entitled to that choice but to call him a leader, is a bit of a stretch. He might inspire people but I don’t see him being the leader some are trying to make him out to be",,,

I gotta give Kenny this one on this segment S/O toHim,,,
Go ahead and Google your trusted company&#39;s criminal record and see why people dont wanna get jabbed,,,
I totally agree with Kenny...putting something in your body that could potentially harm you should be your decision to do so...,,,
Kenny sounds like the only one with some sense on the panel.,,,
It’s amazing how there trying to create this selfish narrative. They want him vaxed so bad!! The reality healthcare is not a group thing. Never was snd never will be no matter what the disease may be. But it’s funny because you can still get it and spread it with or without the vax. So what sacrifice are you making other than to say I did it too. Add nobody asking Brady about his vax status. They didn’t even question Aaron Rodgers until he tested Positive. But back to Kyrie nobody talking about how hypocritical the rule is. Unvaxed player from another team can play but Uncaxed Kyrie can’t play at home. There no logical explanation for that 0… Talk about that.. if Kyrie can’t play no unvaxed player should play in Barclays.,,,
"Most of the people getting the Rona are already vaccinated and they spread it around just as much as the unvaxed do. Kyrie won&#39;t spread it around more than an vaxed person does. Just look at the statistics. His body, his choice.",,,

Much love for kyrie !!!!!stay strong my dude!!!!,,,
"I&#39;m not taking sides regarding vaccination, but logically Kyrie doesn&#39;t HAVE to sacrifice to win the chip. He&#39;s done that already while hitting one of the clutchest shots in NBA finals history. Is it selfish? Maybe so. But if the thing can be resolved with the nets paying a fine for home games, then the problem can be easily solved.",,,
Respect that mans decision to do what he wants as a man. That&#39;s all there is to it,,,
I love KENNY for bringing CONTEXT to this conversation,,,
&quot;they&#39;re not a contender please stop it&quot; lmaooo,,,

Thanks Kenny for providing sound commentary...,,,
"I am with Chuck and Shaq on this one, although I am fine with what Kenny said. From a basketball standpoint, you&#39;d hope Kyrie would take the vaccine so that he can really help the team, especially now that the Nets will not have KD for at least a month. But he stood his ground, which I would give him credit as it is due, and you just hope that the team would not suffer since there is a likely chance that the Nets might fall in the standings in the upcoming games, and for a team that has championship aspirations, this is a gut punch to their hopes.",,,
"Kenny , Charles and Shaquille y&#39;all need to worry about yourself and nobody else and Charles because your VACCINATED on TV and HAVE MONEY don&#39;t make you a real man you guys need to worry about your own family. And keep your opinion to yourself",,,
"Nets let Kyrie do his thing probably because they know that Durant is the more vital piece.  They can still win a ton of games w/out Kyrie.  I don&#39;t think they win a championship without him, but they have enough to make a decent playoff run.",,,

y&#39;all views are becoming nuance in a nuisance way. you know you can still get it. so what ain&#39;t working; the person or the shot?,,,
KD was on the &quot;Steam room&quot; for Christ sake. Now Chuck wants the Nets to lose.,,,

vaccine yes it was good.  Boosters?  Child vaccines?  GTFOH.  I agree with Kyrie,,,
From a warriors fan Chuck I hope they lose too,,,
I just hope they lose lololol,,,
"I love that these guys - or ANYONE for that matter - thinks Kyrie will change his mind on a life decision he’s already made. And make it over a month or a season of basketball where they may not even win the chip. Kyrie already won and got back on the court. He lost some money, but not all. And I believe Kyrie is the kinda player that will be okay without anymore rings but great regardless. He also can truly afford to go through with this choice forever, he doesn’t NEED to play for the money and to live. He’s made plenty already to thrive I’m sure.",,,
How can it be conspiracy if its true Shaq your buggin,,,
Shaq lost me with his stance on this one. Kenny just said you can still spread the virus while vaccinated. Shaq comes right behind him and sat something about conspiracy theory. I&#39;ve never heard Kyrie say he wasn&#39;t going to get vaccinated because of conspiracy theories.,,,

"They spread misinformation, they didn&#39;t get vaccinated, they paid the price with their lives. Sad story for this lady.",,,
None of this makes a damn bit of difference. As long as we are allowing people to use religion or health issue as a factor not to receive the shot then we will never be protected against any variant in the future.,,,

Democrats are getting so bad they are willing to pull you out of your house and have you put in a gas chamber because you are not vaccinated. Reminds me of something in our past where millions were innocently murdered?,,,
Why would you mock anyone who dies? F U  C N N,,,
Never ever need to mock or GLOAT over any family’s loss like that! You can always be classy and cordial and show grace to people even if you disagree or COULD say “told you so”.  Just because you COULD say it doesn’t mean you SHOULD. Grab a CLUE!!!! How awful of these people who have no heart and no conscience and also ZERO class.  What a shame to have you as a fellow American. I’m appalled!! Since WHEN is FREEDOM in America not welcome. Shame be on YOU for your actions and YOUR platform!  Vaccines may be needed and necessary for some or many but not for all and we should have the freedom to choose. Many are okay with vaccine just not mandates.,,,

Did anyone said Natural Selection yet?,,,
Increasing the vaccinations is no guarantee that the numbers will go down. The Vaccine is not a cure nor does it block the virus.  It only helps you create antibodies faster.  The mis information by some medical staff is  shocking.  The good cardiologist speaking her should stick with cardiology if he is good at it. Infection medicine is obviously not his  specialty. No president no matter who it is would have been able to change the infection rate.  The focus should be on creating more monoclonal antibody treatment.  This would save more lives. More than the vaccination alone.,,,

"For this CNN video to have broken even with likes and dislikes -- with the current views of said video being ~ 900k and the likes 3.2k -- it would need (3.2k * 2) votes of the 900k views. The vast majority of the those who viewed it obviously had no intention of watching the video &gt; 1 time, so the vast majority of the 900k views were by individual people. As it stands, 6.4k of, say, 800k viewers is a paltry 0.8% for a break-even, so it&#39;s safe to say that the down votes &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;up votes. My guess is that there are ~ 90k votes, about 11% of those who viewed, voted → 86.8k downvotes to 3.2k up, a ratio of about 27:1 against. Nice work by Big Tech to protect the MSM, of which CNN is the biggest promulgator of the latter&#39;s lies. Congrats to the former for enabling CNN&#39;s fake news.",,,

"Well, I guess there should be at least one educated comment here (I&#39;m a medical student). I guess Anti-vax people just love to scour the Internet, looking to make a comment about anything regarding vaccines. SCOTUS gets to decide what the constitution allows. The constitution is vague. Right-wing people in this country are against vaccine mandates specifically for COVID. We have had mandates for vaccines for various other diseases and there should be no distinction for COVID. However, even if OSHA does not have the power to do this, a mandate needs to be given. Every time a virus infects a person, there is a small chance of a mutation happening that causes a new variant. Vaccines prevent that by not allowing the virus to replicate in the person&#39;s body. Until we get 90% of the world&#39;s population vaccinated for the current dominate variant, there will always be covid. It will never go away. There will always be new variants. And if COVID remains at large, infecting nearly everyone in the world, there is always a chance that COVID can mutate into something far deadlier. Other Coronaviruses exist that are not as infectious, some have up to a 20% mortality rate. At some point, covid-19 can have a variant that is both deadly and infectious. Omicron is very infectious, but not deadly. This puts most people at ease, but it makes epidemiologists scream, because more infectious greatly increases the chance of mutation. If the virus mutates too much, vaccines may no longer protect anyone. Worst case scenario, most humans on the planet end up dying to a future deadly variant that is immune to vaccines (if something becomes immune to vaccines it is also immune to past infections BTW).Seeing all the people on the Internet that probably barely passed science high school classes give their 2 cents is alarming. You don&#39;t know what you are talking about. You&#39;ll be hard-pressed to find a doctor or medical student that supports the anti-vaccine stance. But you can find a small amount of experts in any field that believe contrary to the 99% of the other experts. I believe it is around 95-99% of doctors are vaccinated and most of them support mandates, because doctors know the consequences of letting people freely get infected by this virus.",,,

This guy is funny.  He has no idea how the law works.   He did not listen to the justices as at all.  He is so bias its insane.

"Well, Dr. Reiner and I probably have a different concept of the endemic-COVID society we want to live in. However, I give Dr. Reiner credit. Though I do not personally agree with his take, he makes a very strong rebuttal to SCOTUS&#39; ruling on the OSHA vaccine mandate from a moral and public health perspective. I don&#39;t necessarily think more accurate data and perspectives would&#39;ve changed Justice Thomas&#39; take though. Seems the ruling came from one of legal and civic bases, not on public health. As for Dr. Raja, he says we cannot afford to get COVID at all costs due to the risk of long-COVID. Now, I agree it is a risk, but to what extent? We don&#39;t see people dropping from long COVID in large numbers. It&#39;s an unknown, and I would bet a large number of health experts would agree that unknown risk is pretty small. So, if COVID is to be endemic, but we cannot afford to catch COVID at all costs, is he inferring that masks should become a permanent coerced facet of society? He doesn&#39;t say it, but using this logical approach, that&#39;s the vibe I am getting. And if so, it&#39;s a concept I vehemently oppose as will a number of Americans. And I think he should be careful with this sentiment. Trust in public health officials was already compromised BEFORE COVID came to be; the pandemic only exasperated public dissent. Perhaps he should pick and choose his battles....",,,

They INTENTIONALLY made the first vaccine flawed so they can come on tv and tell us all about their &quot;new vaccine&quot; why does he not tell us about why did Phizer just buy another company for 6 billion dollars that specializes in ... wait for it .. AUTO IMMUNE DISEASES .. Is that maybe because the vaccine Phozer FORCED via corrupted Governments on people may cause auto immune disease ?? Wait for it .....,,,
Get the shot!!!!!...get the shot!!!!!!,,,
The root of all evil is $$$$,,,
Pfizer stock going down,,,
Has he had his yet?...,,,
2 takeaways...1)  he doesn&#39;t like the current safety profile.2) the current vaccines offer very little protection.,,,
Is this guy still a thing?,,,
"Hands up all who think it&#39;s the pharmaceuticals who are telling governments to keep the population afraid and the COVID hype going, all the while making huge profits.",,,
Go away evil merchant,,,
"Here we go again another UEA, when does it stop, the current shots are  and the next ones are probably experimental.",,,
This is insane !!! Talk about money,,,
"If I die I’m just glad I got the chance to live this long, and was able to watch Dune. ATREIDES, ATREIDES, ATREIDES!",,,
"A month ago they said the booster protected you against omicron, now it turns out you need a new vaccine? What the heck?",,,
What is the purpose of Stockpiling? If it works then why would that be needed?,,,
"The snake oil is a complete lie. it will not protect you, this people are criminals, Pfizer has a history of lying and bribing Doctors to lie. Do your research",,,
What a puff piece. Surprised she didn&#39;t get down and do the job for him under the desk as well ...,,,
So 5th/6th shots coming? Or should I say a few more billion dollars for your company?,,,
You people are hypochondriac cultists,,,
send him to jail,,,
Can’t wait!! I need all the vax. Round 5 here we come.,,,
The reason theyre making a new one is cause Phizer DOES nothing. And as he saya over and over they need to keep testing they need to keep experimenting and that what they are doing now with every idiot that gets this experiment injected into them. He has made billions out of this.... wake up!!! @albertbourla,,,
"Did he ever get his shot , just asking!!",,,
"Nice. You have the stock value up, while talking about vaccinating the world. Lots of money to be made on this, conflict of interest?  It’s a good thing your getting rich on a crisis lol hah!! Watch out, the Pharmaceutical companies are getting really rich on this, buying out Senators and Congressmen, do we have a chance? Drug thugs",,,
Pfizer Stock Price,,,
&quot;Protection against hospitalization and serious disease is reasonable as long as you have the 3rd dose&quot;What ever happened to being &quot;fully protected&quot; with 2 doses?,,,
"So he is mixing up talking in the board room and talking on the news. Using words like “fanatics” for people not wanting to take his product. Meanwhile we see the stock prices at all times and in the green, profits for Pfizer how lovely while people’s bank accounts are in the red because they are “fanatics” and lost their job for not talking the JAB.",,,
GREEDY BIG PHARMA!!! YOU MAKE MY STOMACH CHURN! YOU&#39;RE ALL DISGUSTING,,,
We were told the vaccines would stop transmission.  Now we&#39;re told it won&#39;t.  I think Pfizer should give back the money for conning us.,,,
So I gather the 4rth dose is just experimental on Israeli&#39;s,,,

Experiments???,,,
This guy talks as if he just came from another planet. Hard to understand what he is saying....,,,
This guy lies almost as much as a politician,,,
Cant wait til Bourla and CNBC are in the place of darkness where there will be weeping nashing of teeth. Tick tock big pharma and msm.,,,
"Hey bourla my boy!Here&#39;s my favourite Pharisian, you f..ked them so good i can&#39;t wait the new sh.t!!!But hurry up, in march it may be too late, even vaxx golems start to scratch their head",,,
"So let&#39;s rush out yet another vaccine for Omicron -- that will be mandated for everyone to take once Omicron has already come and mostly gone.(Note to self, buy more Pfizer stock)",,,
vaccines are highly effective at preventing illness and preventing transmission. I&#39;m sure this new one will also be really awesome at doing what it is supposed to do. Put your faith in the vaccines and you shall be set free! https://youtu.be/YP5HLWdNEnI?t=309,,,
Vaccines definitely appear not to work?!!!!!!!!! in the nursing home I work at we have over 45 fully vaccinated staff who are positive for Covid. We are so desperate we are working positive staff to cover the floors. what the hell is going on? everybody needs to rise up against all these crazy shots n tests n rules in the world!!!!,,,
He is full of crap! Guaranteed he already has a deal with the government for X amount of units! This guy has gotten a lot more wealthy over the past year! He maxed out his bonus!,,,
"Cash grab 4 real 3 vaccines,  booster, pill what&#39;s next covid liquid cold medication?",,,
The jig is up! They don’t work and one more of the same thing isn’t going to work either! Now tell us why you won’t acknowledge the deaths and injuries!,,,
Funny when he says they are trying to stay head of the virus,,,
Same dude that said 2 shots offer little to no protection. How in the world are people falling for this nonsense???,,,
I think once we have the antiviral aspect on lock we will be able to see a way out. The shot doesn&#39;t seem to be working very well.,,,
He sounds like Javier Bardem...no country for old men...omg!! I can see him say I want you to call it...gas station scene!,,,
I am here to see the comments,,,
I just watched him say the first two shots weren’t good and almost useless! Why trust him now?,,,
What in the living hell.  This guy says current vaccines only provide protection against hospitalization if you have 3 only.  Followed by... can&#39;t give 4 because we don&#39;t have info on that but other countries are doing those experiments... They are giving 4 to the vulnerable in Canada.  Insane....more insane is mandating out of date vaccines. We are all bystanders now and will become what we tolerate.,,,

You&#39;re a fool if you&#39;re still buying into this nonsense.,,,
"The fact that they have already started manufacturing vaccines for Omicron is amazing. It was just discovered at the end if November, and a little more.than a month later they&#39;re manufacturing vaccines for it. Why havent they done that for any other like SARS or MERS?",,,
"limited protection if any.... truth always comes out lawsuits coming for companies that fired people, business that bar people from entering with out vaccine.  The whole point of mandates was because you wanted to prevent the &quot;spread&quot; all lies as usual. People with vaccine still get covid and still spread it so having a mandate or preventing people from entering is idiotic. Somone with vaccine can still have covid and spread it.Whole lot of corruption will be needed for them to pull this off, corrupted studies and many politicians will be needed but the ship already sinking as the good always out number the evil.Even worse for other countries as well who are putting people in camps... when vaccinated still get and spread it.",,,
Can they make a vaccine against becoming an idiot?,,,
"Dumb. So after the booster, we&#39;ll be forced to get an omicron vaccine...And then the next variant will come out, and we&#39;ll need a booster booster, a omicron booster, and the next variant vaccine. Before long, we&#39;ll be getting 6-10 covid vaccines plus a flu shot every 6 months",,,
Biden sucks. Big pharma $$$ unbelievable people are stupid,,,
"Remember guys he can&#39;t do anything wrong, because his ancestors wrote a book millions of years ago calling themselves the &quot;chosen people.&quot;",,,

Why would anyone take this vaccine for Omicron in March? Clearly this strain is already moving through the world. It makes no sense at all. Come on people use your critical thinking skills as to what is happening here? Wake up,,,

Are doing well or are they even alive?&quot; All these questions and no answers. This is why people are not vaccinated. All medication have a warning label and even vitamins have it.

I don&#39;t know why people think that it will.Throughout the pandemic it has been explained that the COVID vaccine&#39;s design was to lessen the effects that required Hospitalizations, and/or dying from it. NOT fully stop transmission, nor deliver full 100% immunity.After as long as it&#39;s been since it started, you WILL get some form of it eventually, even if you don&#39;t happen to feel it&#39;s effects yourself. That&#39;s guaranteed. Just ask those that have been Vaccinated, and HAVE contracted COVID-19 (possibly multiple times), and haven&#39;t needed to go to a hospital once.So, I understand the reason for the mandates. They&#39;re trying to limit the spread to others, IE trying to save lives and keep the world turning.Anyone hear about whole factories shutting down because of it?

It just means that you will be required to be tested regularly. I don&#39;t think expecting people to get vaccinated during a pandemic is too much to ask, but that isn&#39;t even what is being asked. The doctor says that his worry has been the politicization of the vaccine mandate.

It&#39;s part of the 16-year plan but the oh shall we say the owners of the Federal reserves all over the world, and they&#39;ve put it in overdrive due to the loss of 4 years during the Trump administration.

Stop with the BS. The vaccinated caused it,,,
Quickly we need boosters every week …pathetic,,,
I want to see a REAL study on those who have already had it   and then was exposed again  HOW did they fair?????,,,
Omicron is a gift  its more a vaccine than the mRNA,,,
DUH!!  Proving once again that YOUR immune system will  be the best defense IF you have already had it   Because your immune system has the DNA of the entire virus   The mRNA was ONLY for Covid 19,,,
"Vaccines!...Boosters!...More vaccines!...More Boosters!...More and more and more!This world has gone Covid crazy!Come on, crazy people, run out and get more boosters so the Covid boogyman does&#39;t get you!",,,
WELL I JUST GOT OVER OMICRON AFTER 3 WEEKS AND STILL WILL NOT GET THE JAB,,,
I should of bought stock in big Pharma....,,,
so basically the vaccines were a big lie that you were telling everyone and continue to promote even though its clearly not working. And i cant eat horse worm paste because youre the science. apparently,,,

Just buy the 3rd round of the vaccine then watch news about how good vaccines are and look forward to buying more vaccines.,,,

How about first proving the damn thing exists in the first place.,,,

Real vaccines administered in the past when young, some requiring only one booster was enough. The idea that you need a booster every 6 months ad nauseam is ridiculous. Yet here we have the media and other interested parties inventing any old reason to keep taking shots as if they were good old vaccines. Before Covid, how many people were getting vaccinated every 6 months for measles, mumps, etc.??",,,

"It is a natural way to control the over inflammation, it may sound weird but it is a cure. Stay at home during covid infection and follow this thing strictly for fifteen days. I make you sure that covid 19 will never be fatal to anyone , It is my life time experience of pneumonia and inflammation. I often faced pneumonia  severely, earlier if I would have had a little scratch on my body it did become a huge wound within some days and it did take months to get it  treated. I have suffered the hellish pain of pneumonia and inflammation through out my life. When antibiotics stopped working I followed this tip very strictly and it&#39;s been two years, I  won&#39;t face neither pneumonia nor inflammation, I have a very sensitive body and if I eat a tiny thing that is a little inflammatory, my body immediately acts upon  that, if I eat two or three pieces of bread I got a body ache, if I eat an orange I got sneezing immediately and if I eat a vegetable or a root , it takes me two to three days but my body tells me that it was inflammatory too, consumption of a garlic clove continuesly for three or four days makes me sick, if I eat an onion or some ginger contained foods continuesly for two or three days I got the same result. Having a so sensitive body I eat a lemon daily,   and it doesn&#39;t affect me any way. I can eat sour curd and, it does no harm to me, but I can not eat an apple or an orange . Pneumonia made my body too sensitive so have differentiated these inflammatory and anti-inflammatory foods  and, I have been working on this theory for a long time, it took me more than 20 years to sort out these foods . Apply the following diet plan strictly for some days during covid 19 infection and you have no fear of any type of pneumonia and inflammation. If this thing is followed strictly, I make you sure on it that covid 19 or it&#39;s variants will never be fatal  for anyone, the doctors will never recommend you this thing because they do not know. A human body takes 15 days to produce antibodies against any virus and it is a natural way to avoid the over inflammation. Non - inflammatory food list 1. All the meaty products [everything, like eggs,  pork, beef, mutton, chicken, fish etc.(eat them  grilled or boiled or you can use pure mustard oil or pure butter clarified to cook them )] . 2. Wheat ( and all the products that are made from pure wheat, not biscuits, cookies or breads because they contain vegetables oil). 3. Gram, cheakpea( chana or kabuli chana). Masoor dal. 5. Green leaves like spinach, lettuce, etc.  ( green leaves mustn&#39;t be sour, bitter or spicy ). 6. All the Dairy products (they must be made from pure animal milk like butter clarified,  curd, cheese, fresh milk ). 7. Pure Mustard oil, turmeric powder, red chili powder , white sugar, sea salt, coriander powder and leaves, butter clarified. 8. Lemon and curd ( lemon and curd are non - inflammatory things  but they act differently with different  foods, with the suggested foods they never be a cause for inflammation). If someone get affected with covid 19, he must avoid lemon for some days because he already would have eaten something that lemon acts as an inflammatory thing. But if the patient would have been  eating  the suggested diet very strictly for more than 18 days then he can add lemon  in his regular diet it will never be inflammatory then. The patient has to apply this diet plan very very strictly because consumption of a single fruit,dry fruit, vegetable or vegetable oil, onion, garlic, ginger and all non suggested cereals , lentils and a little thing besides the suggested diet may affect the whole result, so apply this thing strictly for fifteen days and see the result by yourself. Note- feed your infants with mother milk or pure animal milk,( formula  milk acts like a poison during the covid 19 infection because it contains vegetables oil.(if the patient follows this diet plan strictly his body acts over covid 19 like an animal body does, he may  get affected  but  never faces the worst, and he never be needed to be hospitalized ).(covid 19 is fetal for those patients whose body act overwhelmingly on covid 19, if  someone&#39;s body doesn&#39;t act overwhelmingly he never faces over inflammation  and it&#39;s nothing but a different sort of comman cold for him, if you follow this diet plan your body never act overwhelmingly on covid 19 believe me Our natural immune system is capable to neutralize this virus, but it needs time because a human body does take 15 days to produce antibodies against any virus, and it is not covid 19 that kills the patient directly but it is a cause for death. The thing that kills the patient, it is over      inflammation, because it destroyes our respiratory system and in lack of oxygen our whole system get destroyed and the  situation becomes dreadful.,.,.,.,.,.,",,,

"AIDS vs COVIDCan you imagine if we had treated people with AIDS the way we are treating the unjabbed? Can you imagine if we had deprived people with AIDS the right to work, to travel, to visit dying family and friends, if we had denied them the right to attend funerals, weddings, concerts, sporting events... Can you see a world where we would have deprived them of access to medical services, and created &quot;quarantine camps&quot; for them? Can you imagine if we had told them that unless they changed their lifestyle and placed less of a strain on hospitals, and on society, they would be ostracized? And treated as subhumans? Can you imagine if we had told them we would starve them out by denying them access to grocery stores? AIDS (I mean Fauci with AZT and other meds) has killed millions of people  worldwide. It was being spread almost uncontrollably in Africa and has been a huge economic burden to many contries all over the world. In spite of all of that we never banned African people from traveling to other countries, made them wear unhealthy masks, tested them repeatedly, wear them wear any sort of identifier or done anything else to ritualistically shame them. We never implemented AIDS free passports or anything of the sort. We remained human? We remained compassionate? We didn&#39;t genetically alter ourselves our demand that others genetically modify themselves. As a global society we behaved with morals and ethics. We exhibited concern and care for those who were sick. Doctors didn&#39;t run like cowards from their hypocratic oath? They conducted themselves honorably and didn&#39;t euthanize the elderly, or young children just to play a misleading statistics game. As a society treating people as if they were less than human because of a lifestyle choice or because of an infirmity would have been seen as reprehensible. How did we get to where we are? Why have we allowed the vile elite to dehumanize us just so they could implement their great economic reset and impose their new world order? Why was it so easy for so many to discard their mantra of equality for everyone? Why was it so easy for so many to ignore big pharmas trillion dollar interest and profits? Why has it been so easy for so many to sever their ties to family and friends because of what should be their private medical decisions and for exercising their bodily autonomy? Are we human beings acting more like robots than human beings? Are allowing ourselves to be programmed through fear based trauma? Are we allowing ourselves to be programmed through repetitive fear mongering of cases of infection and death, with false positives and counting deaths of other causes as virus deaths? As a society have we abandoned our instinct to question? Have we simply become willful believers of obvious lies? Have we chosen to believe in government and media because we don&#39;t want to believe in God anymore? Have we been led to this apathy and indifference towards others little by little? Have we been led little by little to abandon our love of true mental, physical and spiritual freedom and cultural diversity? When did we get to the point where we thought it was ok to tell others what their religious beliefs are or what their religious beliefs should be? And how did we get to such an arrogant point of faux spiritualness? Are we truly progressing? Or are we regressing towards a global tyranny where only one opinion, one perspective, one doctrine is tolerated? Our we enslaving ourselves to a one world tyranny, one world order? Do we really want a world where everyone thinks the same, acts the same, says the same thing? Do we really want a global society that behaves like robots just so the introduction of robots and AI is more easy to assimilate? Should we roboticize ourselves just so we can cohabit the planet with AI and robots? Is that progress? Is that evolution? Or is that a dystopia we wouldn&#39;t wish on our worst enemy? We have seen what absolute control and absolute power does to people? It destroys the values humans hold dear to them in that tyrannical leader, i.e (Stalin,Hitler, Franco, Mussolini, Mao Zedong, Xi Jin ping, Kim Jung Um, Trudeau, Macron, Pinochet...) And society is tortured, maimed, genocided &quot;for the well being of all&quot;. Society and human life is treated as if it were the excrement of the elites. We have seen the morals and values kings and queens have appropriated for themselves over the last few centuries and millennia. If all of society must be sacrificed for their well being, then so be it. That is what the Machiavellis and the Marquis De Sades have taught them. We the people, the masses, we cannot surrender our humanity and our souls so that the insatiable avarice of the multi billionaires can continue to be fed. Many people have realized that this virus is a pretext for a spiritual war. Are you going to offer up your soul to the decadent, evil billionaires proclaiming themselves to be philanthropist? Or are you going to maintain your humanity, your soul, your dignity and reject all of these evil mandates, dictates and laws that aim to eliminate the value of a free and independent human being?",,,
Not a vaccine you freaks,,,
Have fun in ur tin box locked up  like China.,,,
Haven’t seen any commercials for these.  Why? You’d have to list the side effects…,,,

You think that your side-effects are once in a blue moon. You think you&#39;re special. The risk is higher than you think,,,
"Recuperation from covid is 98.8% I had it, and was 3 weeks in bed drinking water, electrolytes and total rest, could not stomach food. When I stand up it took me another 3 weeks to get back to normal. I was left an old woman   No doctor was available they could not care less they run like rats in hiding. When vaccines came about my telephone did not stopped ringing. So now they cared  I will never put my life in the line of an experiment to save someone else’s. Why the CEO of Pfizer is not vaccinated?",,,
"Man you are an intelligent adult. Vaccines protections do not last, what is the point of someone that appears intelligent put their live on the line and possible either died or be left for life with a side effect. Recovering from covid is 98.8% without any chemical merda in your body. Jesus is there some intelligent people?",,,

Paid shill interviewing unpaid fool,,,
You can’t make this shit up…I had Covid a few weeks ago…I would rather go through Covid then have GBS,,,
Sorry  ... many had covid and are healthy and fine now and have antibodies. We do not want or need a vax that can ruin our health.,,,
Just scared of this shit. Not the virus.. i know what that does... the vaccine however is a different breed.. no clue what its gonna do to me or for how long or if i survive it. Not an anti vaccer.. just scared of this one.,,,

Who told him to lie ?,,,

Would you really know where I have your advice?,,,
It fucked me up so you should take it too. Wtf?! No.,,,
Who even trusts CNN...,,,
"Wow, this is what shows up when you search for “vaccine injury”. It’s pure propaganda.",,,
You say that  GBS reaction is exceedingly rare.  How do you know it is rare?  Did J &amp; J tell you it is a rare side effect?,,,
Yeah because the vaccine fell from heaven directly from the hand of God. It needs to be trusted 100% the same with the government and media. They wouldn&#39;t ever lie to you and your best interests are at heart they love you unconditionally.,,,
If the vaccine  doesn’t stop you from getting it….or stop you from spreading it….and there are known side effects….what is the point of getting it?,,,
Brain Clots too,,,

"My friend&#39;s family are completely healthy and no health issues before since they always eat healthy foods  but when they got vaccinated they got non-stop coughing and have cold.

"Absolutely amazes me.  YES, GB Syndrome - is rare, but far from unheard of.  Cardiac problems, mycocarditis ... are other side effects - and are far less rare. Yet, we still have a percentage of people who will ask &quot;how high?&quot;, when told to &quot;JUMP&quot; by Big Pharma, Big Govt, Big Media.  This guy seems like a reasonable person with half a brain.  He SHOULD have learned that making your body/immune system HEALTHY will protect 99+% of us from problems with this virus.  Just blows me away.",,,
The chances we&#39;ve had with no vaccine has been working just fine..and we didn&#39;t need side effects to prove it,,,
allegedly Johnson &amp;Johnson has not been one to be forthcoming with Truth!!!!! after HEARING about  them KNOWING the SERIOUSNESS of getting CANCER from their BABY POWDER...  they knew and didn&#39;t SAY ANYTHING for YEARS   &quot;&quot;allegedly  &#39;&#39;&quot; because of PROFIT...

This is so wrong.,,,
"The public bought into vaxing based on their fears, which is a very powerful motivator. How would the public fair if they more feared getting the vax?",,,
"If you want to know who the enemy is, look at who and what you’re not allowed to criticize.. it doesn’t matter if you are healthy and capable...you’re still a threat to the health and safety of everyone who is vaccinated..and therefore you need this vax or other won’t be safe.",,,

Vaccines/ flu shots are always behind. In a few months a new variation will be here. Nice try though.,,,
Today staff must be on some serious narcotics if they think for a second people will take more of this.,,,
"Where can I get a booster shot for US citizen, will pay.",,,
Now a days young persons are facing erectile dysfunction problems due to covaxin vaccination. There is huge que at sexologist..and neurologist..Take the data from the que you will come to know..,,,
Boil onions garlic and ginger then eat it! all these vaccines are made with things already existing! please be safe from the top sinner in the world.  God is perfect,,,
"Why take a booster? I have had omicron for 5 days so far, only symptom was a runny nose for 2 days. I am unvaccinated and live off of Dr Pepper, Pizza, and Doritos.",,,
too little too late. its all about money. nee variant will be out by then.,,,
"Videos like this are hard to come by they are mostly outdated, and I&#39;m wondering where all the agenda pushing channels have gone. And then it turns out that everyone in the comments agrees on one thing. So then how is this even going forward? The only ones who actually agreed with this are hiding in the dark somewhere",,,
Stay home for 30 days?!?! A 4th shot!?! They really aren’t going to let this end.,,,
Liberals two years ago: anyone who makes more than $1 million should be taxed at 40% or more. The rich don’t care about the rest of us! Liberals now: shut up you stupid conspiracy theorist! Why would a billionaire want to keep a pandemic going that’s making their company tens of billions of dollars!? They clearly just want to help you!,,,
I love how these liberals walking around in cloth masks claim to follow the science but couldn’t tell you the procedure for properly fitting a real mask if they were given 24 hours and a textbook on it. If this virus was truly as bad as you all make it out to be we would be in full face respirator‘s changing out out P100 cartridges every day,,,
Faulty testing an testing doesn’t do anything because there’s no cure,,,
It won&#39;t end until you make it end,,,
Lol roll it out in a few months when omicron is gone,,,
Of course they are with so much money $ in play they will milk this as long as they can.,,,
"Only about 1/2 of Boston, MA nurses quit/got fired over the vaccine mandates. You know when a front line nurse refuses the jab it is because he/she has seen how harmful the jabs are.",,,
He should be impeached,,,
Money grab by scaring people by the time this vaccine rolls out omnicorn will be gone just as delta went away,,,
"My whole family has omicron. I&#39;ve had both shots and the current booster and I have to say, I&#39;m the best off out of everyone. I&#39;ve barely had any symptoms, whereas, my wife isn&#39;t up to date on her&#39;s and she&#39;s felt like crap.",,,
30 miles west of Boston: 40 Vaccinated relatives gathered to enjoy Christmas together. In the end all 40 relatives went home infected with Covid &amp; soon to experience the pain of the Covid disease.,,,

FOXTROT JOLIET BRAVO,,,
goodness I went on a trip through the comments and I&#39;m like &quot;I hope yall still alive to keep complaining in 2023&quot;,,,
"I&#39;m 4 doses in and I&#39;ll happily get this one, too, but we&#39;re still all going to need to be in masks and whatnot.",,,
I’m not a lab rat. How many will be needed until it actually works? 20? Come on man!,,,
C o v i dI s B o g u s,,,
Your 4th shot will be shot down.,,,
The vaccines are the virus and boosters are the reinforcement of it and Big Pharma making BILLIONS on the SHEEP falling for this virus crap- these poor scared uninformed people +++ DONT ALLOW YOUR CHILD TO BE VACCINATED IT WILL CHANGE THEM FOREVER,,,
No one wants them. GO AWAY!,,,
Remove all the “doctors” that push this Bull! And stop going to the hospital over nothing! The stupidity in this world is high! When will the media pay for their lies?,,,
"Is there any way I or my cells can opt out at the 10th dose level?? How about the 20th dose? Okay, by the 30th I&#39;m really gonna be looking for a checkbox, 1-800 number or special prayer to get out of this medical nightmare.",,,
"The vaccine will be ready. It will be just as ineffective as the others, but it will be ready",,,
In the next few months ?  Omicron will have come and gone by then and  we will have  another variant by  the time this  shot comes out.  If they are working an omicron booster  what was the point of the booster shot I just took yesterday.   This does not inspire confidence about  the  booster shots we are getting now.  Why get  the current booster  if they need to make a new one   specifically for omicron .   I could have skipped the current booster and waited for the new omicron booster . I have already had  3 shots in  a 7 month period  and now  I need another  one  within the next few months.   I have no problem  getting a covid shot  once a year  form here on out  but I am not willing to get  one  every 4 months.  They need to make a proper  vaccine that stops the spread  and provides long lasting  immunity  instead  of these  short lasting  sort of effective  vaccines.  Seems like they are  trying to milk  the cash cow  for  all its worth.,,,
Then after that will be voltron now thats legend,,,
Next virus wil be megatron,,,
Propaganda,,,
no one heard about kids till shot came out for them how bout lock down for the comen cold you cant cure,,,
"Just say no. It doesn&#39;t work. You can still get sick, you can still spread it, if you take the jab.",,,
This is so idiotic!,,,
"I am anti mandate, but I know SO many people with covid right now. Two people passed away, one was in the hospital for a while but the rest just bad cold symptoms. This virus is so weird how it effects people differently.",,,
"Waste of time, negative efficacy already appearing with past “cocktails”.  Time to halt this crime being carried out on mankind!",,,
"I&#39;m selling popsicles and I can tell you that if you buy at least 36 green ones, you won&#39;t get the herpona.",,,
Omicron will be gone before the vaccine is available.,,,
Next thing a zombie apocalypse happens what will the government do,,,
The time it comes out it will be over.,,,
More money for Big Pharma,,,
Weren’t they working on a Delta booster 3 months ago?  No update yet!!!,,,
I want my omnifart vaccine. 10 boostas and a hot Fraudci latte please.,,,

This is never gonna end. They can&#39;t let a good &quot;pandemic&quot; go to waste its a powergrab.,,,
Let&#39;s take one example shall we.....AOC was triple vaccinated and huge advocate for obeying the government without question and yet she still got the STD (socially transmitted disease) covid so tell me again how taking these shots every other month is suppose to stop the spread? That&#39;s right... it doesn&#39;t lol,,,
Ugh... Money money money... This is a big joke...,,,
When will someone be held accountable? Everyone at that Wuhan lab should have a bounty on their head.,,,

Now you&#39;re taking an infected workers wearing proper shield and mask Why can you do the same for the unvaccinated workers you send home for not taking the vaccine. Let them wear a protective mask and work. Bunch of Hypocrites Democrats do the right thing and stop being fooled by People that is bleeding America and want American&#39;s jobs. Open your eyes. Why would you discriminate against a person that put an ingredients together make a tea that&#39;s getting rid of a virus you cannot cure. Stop fighting against my gift i am natural, and being Stop angry it just makes your work harder.

anyone taking money from Pfizer for ads is criminally liable. DON&#39;T DESTROY YOUR COMMUNICATIONS. PRESERVE ALL RECORDS. we are coming... &quot;Top vaccine providers&quot; means drug dealers,,,
Who cares.Thumbs down,,,
Aren’t we so excited  we getting another f**** shot,,,
&quot;most of them hospitalized are unvaxxed&quot;  thats where i stopped listening.,,,

The booster should be the flu shot!,,,
I&#39;m sure the fifth booster will save us. If you don&#39;t get the sixth booster you hate your grandma. I&#39;m sick of these nazis who wont get their necessary 7th booster.,,,
By the time Fauci gets done with you. Your going to look like a pin Cushin science project,,,
Never had the COVID shot and won&#39;t get one and never got tested too,,,
Useless &quot;vaccines&quot;! Bunch of BS!,,,
CEO doesn’t know much about the vaccine.But it’ll be ready for you today.,,,
,,,
If you don’t get the booster you ain’t black,,,
I&#39;m unvaccinated and I cannot visit my dad who&#39;s vaxxed and just had surgery In the hospital. This should be illegal.,,,
"I wasn’t going to take the vaccine. I thought Covid was a flash in the pan and it would just go away. Well, I waited 2 years and it just got worse and mutated. I finnaly decided to get the vax. The cases in NM today topped 5,000 with 36 deaths. It’s getting worse by the day. I’m glad I got it now. I stay in as jmuch as possible and mask and distance when I’m out. Fear of Covid overcame my fear of the shot. Looks like we are in for the long haul. Stay home and stay safe.",,,

Omicron death rate? More boosters for IHU variant and Delcron?,,,
4th shot later this year a 5th shot next year a 6th 7th 8th 9th and 10th shot they just want to give you a shot every 6 months and make billions off of it,,,
"So you&#39;re just ignoring that the Pfizer CEO admitted that covid shots give, quote, &quot;limited, if any, protection against covid&quot;?",,,
2025 = &quot;Now we have a 15th booster shot for the newest variant!&quot; - at this point people seriously dont care anymore.,,,
does this one give us strokes and heart attacks too or did you figure that out yet?,,,
LOL 4th one now yall sheep just cant get enough huh,,,
Just  stop. Give it up. This is just pathetic,,,
"This will continue to happen until 2024, guarantee it. They don&#39;t really even know the long term effects of this vaccine.",,,
No thanks.,,,
If they make changes to the current vaccine shouldn&#39;t there be new testing periods? Or have we accepted they make changes and we just inject new recipes in our bodies without long term data?,,,
Stop lying to us . We’re not stupid.,,,
No,,,
"The simple Gospel is to trust in the shed Holy Blood of Christ Jesus. BELIEVE in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ is the Gospel! 1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 which is the Gospel tells us that we are saved by trusting in the Lord Jesus death, burial, and resurrection. Ephesians 1: 13-14 says that we are sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise until the day that God redeems us. Ephesians 2: 8-9 is clear in that we are saved by grace through faith and not by our works or by what we do or do not do.",,,
these are children who have been breast feeding or in wombs of mothers who were vaxxed.,,,
"Maybe Pfizer will soon give out punch cards, free sandwich with your 10th booster shot, one of them&#39;s gotta work, right?",,,
"Stupidity - omicron will already have infected 90% of those it was going to by 2 months from now.Omicron is a perfect example of how pandemics have always ended, throughout all history.  A milder, super-spreading form that gives the entire population strong, long-term, protection.",,,
Pureblood till death.,,,
Even if they say its been fda approved im still not getting any covid vaccine,,,
how about we cure kidney disease? not a single innovation in that industry in 50 years,,,
"So now it all comes full circle, NOW they will &quot;erradicate&quot; COVID probably because the denizens of the world proved that they wouldn&#39;t stay in this &quot;pandemic&quot; that definitely wasn&#39;t dragged out as long as possible. Not to disrespect those that lost their lives.",,,
It tackles all forms.  Wow.  Amazing!  Tell me more.  I can hardly wait for the next planned 100 year outbreak.,,,
That’s cool. I’ll NEVER get vaccinated. But please feel free to keep trying to shove it down our throats.,,,
Notice they keep showing black people taking the shot...,,,
&quot;Warpspeeded&quot;...brilliant.,,,
"I don&#39;t get it. If omicron is not very lethal, exactly why do you need to boost? Public policy needs to at least pass the smell test, and this doesn&#39;t.",,,
"I have natural immunity, I don&#39;t worry at all Fauci.",,,
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s how vaccinations work.,,,
"This is just going to give them a reason to force it on all of us. As u can see, these stupid vaccines don’t actually work or stop it.",,,
"Um, duh",,,
Step one: create a virus to get Donald trump out of office.Step 2: make a &quot;vaccine&quot; and profit from the virus. Step 3: see step 2,,,
"lol Even before the pandemic, research on both coronaviruses and vaccine candidates against emerging pathogens was a priority for agencies operating in the public health space. In 2015 they all ready had it this was all plan out 300 billion worth they made",,,
Well the other vaccines worked so well. Can&#39;t wait to see a &quot;Universal&quot; version.,,,
No thanks,,,
When you give a BOOST!,,,
God going get you wicked people and you going wish you never hurt his children,,,
"Yeah, while Big Pharma fights in court to conceal its safety data for 75 years. Hard pass...Money money money.Money.",,,

"Since the shots don&#39;t last very long, we should be able to buy them in bulk at Costco. A 24 pack should get us thru the week.",,,
The military already did this...this is nothing more than an easy escape-hatch for all the criminals to run through who are now trapped in their own lies. A fake narrative started this whole thing and a fake narrative is going to end it. Charges of Crimes against humanity and Treason need to be issues to all involved and military tribunals need to happen...civilian court is not equipped to deal with this level of betrayal. There should be absolute no peace until all are brought to justice.,,,
Imagine believing this propaganda,,,
"It&#39;s over, people. The Omicron variant may be contagious, but it is not fatal.Cases may be up, but deaths are WAY, WAY, WAY down. That&#39;s why you only hear about the number of cases and not deaths.Wake up.",,,
Natural infection already does all of this. Targeting only the spike protein with a vaccine is the reason we&#39;re in this situation right now. Or maybe that was always part of the plan...,,,
"Hegelian dialectic, problem, reaction, solution.",,,
LOL!!,,,
Fauci is so smart.. It&#39;s incredible,,,
You know what the world needs....a vaccine to stop BS from transmitting.,,,
"So every American is going to get this virus and develop a natural immunity for it. All the previous shots still let you get infected by the variant they were rated for per CDC, Pifizer CEO hosted on this network. Yet NBC and other news stations are pushing that it is okay to tax, dehumanize, and take people to internment camps for not subscribing to a mega medical corporation that is forcing multiple medical experiments onto your neighbors.",,,
0:48 USB Disconnect,,,
Ha ha ha ha Didn’t they promise how they did develop the vaccine? What a joke! People are just stupid.,,,
YAWN!,,,
"Which scientists?? The ones who created the virus, (CDC and Fouchi) or honest scientists that are truly trying to stop it? Should be tried as a war crime with Fouchi at the top of the list, total hypocrite.",,,
YAH Another Shot. How many total are they going to try and get into people.,,,
Notice how &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; are the only ones telling the truth this whole time.,,,
"OG vax didn&#39;t stop COVID but this one, ladies and gentlemen, will. Trust us.",,,
"This little criminal spends so much time pitching his line of snake-oil shots, I wonder how he will find time to fund development of the next virulent virus, having no purpose other than being a bio-weapon. He claims it wasn&#39;t accidentally leaked from the lab, and it doesn&#39;t naturally come from bats - so is the only other option that it was not leaked by accident? He predicted around 2018 a world wide pandemic during Trump&#39;s term. He&#39;s proved himself a liar in congressional hearings, and his emails implicate him. Yet the mainstream news gives him continued airtime? Of course! - he&#39;s owned by the same folks who own the news.",,,
This must be a joke.,,,
"Last year:  You can&#39;t transmit or get covid if you have a vaccine, it&#39;s a wonder drug!This year:  You can still transmit &amp; get covid if you have a vaccine, also take the 4th boosterNow they want to sell you another wonder drug, how many boosters do you think this will have?  Congratulations, you&#39;ve turned your immune system into a subscription service.  Remember, they have no liability towards any side effects, heart attacks, or death",,,

Still not taking it.,,,
everything that they say is a lie lol.,,,

Gee who’s going to pay for this round…..,,,

It&#39;s all fun and games until the people wake up. Then comes the pain!...... Tick tock.,,,

Are we using the real definition of vaccine (like the polio or small pox vaccines)? Or are we using the new definition?,,,
I’ll never take any vax again. I don’t trust anyone now..    but I would like to see how many dislikes your video has..  good thing YouTube hides it for you ..,,,
"Oh goody! I hope that their scientific efforts include gain of function research. What could go wrong with that? Vaccine pushers will be delighted with this news, but those of us that engage in critical thinking should be afraid.",,,
"I have a universal solution too. It&#39;s called, being healthy with a powerful natural immune system.",,,
"that&#39;s nice, I&#39;m still not taking it",,,
"Let’s hope our Freedom Of Choice stays distinctive considerably , due to our transportation or masking benefits, and having to take these boosters even.It can get a lot worse if the government trends these medical procedures more forceful or consequential in future reference, specifically if never taking the vaccines may loose eligibility in sorts of occupation or conveyance, and leading sorts of people who aren’t vaccinated too imprisonment or situated in unnecessary refuges that’s emblematic.",,,
So there will be yet another shot for everyone to take?,,,

"Genesis 19 1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. 3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did brake unleavened bread, and they did eat. 4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter: 5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. 6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, 7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. 8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as it is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. 9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door. 10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut the door. 11 And they smote the men that were at the door at the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door. 12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: 13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it. 14 And Lot went out, and spoke unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. 15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. 16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and sent him without the city. 17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to to mountain, lest thou be consumed. 18 And Lot said unto them, Oh,  not so, my Lord: 19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 20 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. 21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken. 22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. 23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. 24 Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord of heaven; 25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. 26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. 27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord. 28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as a smoke of furnace. 29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities which Lot dwelt. 30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: 32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesterday with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 37 And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. 38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.",,,
"Journalistic Misinformation: &quot;HPV vaccine ...wipes out the majority of cervical cancers!&quot;?  CORRECTION: The HPV vaccine stops SOME variants of the Human Papilloma Virus that cause all types of cervical cancer.

I agree with Rick Sanchez, help me understand how your are going to magically create something that you have been unable to create for any other virus that kills millions every year.",,,
the comments are cancerous lol,,,
When the Chinese steal it?,,,
Pfizer has a bad history for fatal medicine in the U.S. Look at the court cases.,,,
,,,
how many more smh.. just add some herion to it so we all get addicted to vaccines..,,,
oh really? what about 5? can we get a 666?,,,
I&#39;ll take partial defense over no defense. I wouldn&#39;t take a 4th shot. Just wait for the Omnicron specific  booster in March instead.,,,
Let&#39;s all pretend to be shocked,,,
We are test subjects.,,,
"Biden was ahead of you, he’s on his 5th booster just in case.",,,
Shocker,,,
Elites act like they’re worried about a virus. What they really should start worrying about is when the masses inevitably come together like white blood cells and topple their disgusting New World Order.,,,
I bet it will with the 5th shot!,,,
Legend has it that after the tenth jab you’ll start looking and acting like Chicago’s mayor,,,
Real vaccines have taken years to make.   I wonder if any company is still working on making a real vaccine.,,,
We don&#39;t know what the long term effects will be to the body due to this madness that continues to be forced. Don&#39;t know what&#39;s in it. They want 55 years to release. So much wrong with this situation and no one seems to be able to stop this.,,,
Lmmfao that’s because it’s not a vaccine,,,
So why the Mandates again?,,,
"It will give you more immunity by mentally making you think you are vaxed!!!!!!! yea, that&#39;s it!!! That&#39;s the ticket!!!!",,,
Is fauchi related to Jim Jones.,,,
On my 14th jab now. Lost both my legs and hands. Skin looks like an old Avocado. Just received my 2nd pig heart replacement. Never felt better. #FJB,,,
"Is it just me, or is she lip syncing?",,,
Keep doing it until your body don’t feel anything anymore.....at all,,,
LOL.LOL....what a sick joke!,,,
I’ve taken no jabs and am still alive and well and doing just fine,,,
MORE VACCINES AND NO VALIDATION IF THEY WORK OR NOTFU GOVERNMENT NEVER IN MY LIFE I WILL BOW DOWN TO SUBMISSION,,,
It’s ok I’m ready for my 5 shot…. That one should do it!!! All hail the tyrannical government,,,
Shit Jab,,,
I&#39;m gonna go for a vaccine blood transfusion where I remove all blood and operate on pure vaccine....this isn&#39;t proven to be healthy but ill be a way better person than you,,,
They are concerned because the only natural variant is coming out in March...,,,
They&#39;re experimenting on you!,,,
LMAO!  Color me surprised!,,,
YOU DON&#39;T SAY?Neither did the prior ones.Myocarditis anyone?,,,
Pfizer gonna be like &quot;For best protection you may need a 5th or 6th booster. No refunds will be given.&quot;,,,
,,,
"They&#39;re still calling it a vaccine lolVaccines innoculate, boys and girls!",,,
lets try daily vaccine shots... lol,,,
israel going is world is very good working,,,
"If the 4th shot didn&#39;t work, then surely the 5th will! After the 6th one though, I might get a little skeptical of the seventh.",,,
Where does natural immunity play into this? Or does that just not exist anymore? This is laughable at this point.,,,
Yesterday you said it did. Why is it so easy for you folks to just lie lie lie?,,,
A surprise is a fart with a lump in it.,,,
God can ! Repent and turn to God,,,
"all of these so called experts need to give their profits to the &quot;Ordinary Citizens,&quot; the so called &quot;conspiracy&quot; theorist; who, have been at the forefront of this epidemic since before its beginning",,,
Why risk your life and health for vaccines that have been proven to be ineffective?  Do people no longer do any research especially when it comes to their health?,,,
I was considering being a weatherman because you can be wrong most of the time and still have a job.  But now I&#39;m going to be a covid scientist because you can be wrong all of the time and still have a job.,,,
Won&#39;t block the 8th one either...,,,
When is the next variant coming out?,,,
No shit,,,
Modern Science research today1+1=41+1=41+1=2  this isnt right do it again 1+1=41+1=41+1=41+1=41+1=41+1=41+1=41+1=41+1=41+1=41+1=41+1=41+1=41+1=41+1=41+1=41+1=4,,,
More of the same ineffective crap will not make it effective.,,,
I&#39;m shocked!,,,
"This is sick, Doctors have already reported that last way of virus want kill you, think twice before you take this 4th shot, they haven&#39;t tested it before they give it to human, don&#39;t be a lab rat.",,,
"So they have a vaccine designed for a virus; then the virus MUTATES (= changes) and they believe that if they just give ENOUGH of the old vaccine, they&#39;ll fight the mutated virus off?",,,
Why am I not surprised?,,,
"Duh, it&#39;ll only work after the 6th. Everyone knows that. Hurry up and go get&#39;em kids.",,,
The Government paid billions for a vaccine that would provide lasting immunity. We got a lemon that lasts a few months. Do we get a refund?,,,
Sad trombone noises,,,
Have fun sheep this isn&#39;t going to end https://youtu.be/QinDAECELwU,,,
Shocking!,,,
Leaky vaccine,,,
"...yes...yes...but the 5th will work for sure..! The appointment window it’s open, people...",,,
Holy smokes imagine that. By the 7th booster they should have things under control.,,,
What does doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result define again?I “forgot&quot;?,,,
UK reports repeated boosting isn’t good for your immune response.,,,
"This isn’t surprising, given the high number of mutations I understand omicron to have from the original strain. What’s surprising is the number of institutions that thought it would still work. And the number that think vaccine mandates are somehow justified, especially in spite of this.",,,
"Correct, at this point this is to be expected. Our antibodies are high enough, once the virus gets into our system, we will feel symptomatic infection and our body will knock it on it&#39;s ass in less than 5 days. most of us will be asymptomatic. We need to stop trying to get to the point where we have 0 symptoms, this will either come naturally or through herd immunity. Rality is that Omicron is here to stay and we need to stop acting like this is the first time we&#39;ve seen a goddamn virus!  Get vaccinated, get the first booster... let&#39;s see if it is possible to get a Omicron specific booster or if it even matters. Let&#39;s get back to work and open up the damn country. Asymptomatic positive cases need to get back to work! Ill patients need to stay home and get better just as we see with the Influenza!",,,

Go get your cat some ice cream, or re-dye your hair purple. Heck, maybe go a little crazy and start an onlyfans. Progressives unite! 16 shots is our goal. We stand with science!",,,
"I keep wondering every day (And have been for months)  When are people going to ADMIT that the vaccine doesn&#39;t really work well?   You can take 10 shots of it, and it won&#39;t really help you..

"Wait a minute! - the Supreme Court&#39;s recent rulings re VAX mandates can be confusing! The public needs LOTS of clarification!!!  - STAT While employees may be informed in the coming days as to if/how these rulings apply to them, the PUBLIC needs to know as well - &quot;Can I be assured that those I interact with for health/everyday services - are vaccinated?&quot; And how can I, as a concerned family member, responsible for a vulnerable person, be assured that my elders, disabled spouse or sibling, or my child are safe - &quot;What assurance do I have that individuals who serve them daily and in close contact - are vaccinated?&quot;What constitutes &quot;health care workers&quot; who are subject to the mandate? Does the mandate apply only to licensed health workers (i.e doctors, RNs, LPNS, OT/PT, etc) in hospitals and other health care settings? Or does it also apply to others employed in those settings who have contact with patients (i.e. receptionists, lab techs, dietary workers, housekeeping and cleaners, activity assistants)? If the intent of the VAX-for-health-care-workers mandate is to protect patients/those who are vulnerable, then it seems it should apply to ALL who work within any health care setting.And what constitutes a &#39;health care setting&#39;? - hospitals of course, but what about adult care facilities and day centers, doctors&#39; offices, lab and other testing facilities (i.e. e-rays, mammograms, CAT &amp; MRI scans, colonoscopies) - all of these are defined by close contact with patients or other vulnerable individuals.And what about facilities where people are confined, who are vulnerable, and may not have a choice or the ability to choose with whom and how closely they interact. I am thinking of mental health facilities, homes for the disabled, group homes and residential child care facilities, even prisons.  This isn&#39;t just about the employees&#39; safety; if the Court doesn&#39;t want to put OSHA in the position of policing a VAX mandate in the work environment, what about the government&#39;s duty to protect vulnerable populations? I would think that advocates for vulnerable populations would be seeking clarity on this - ASAP.",,,

According to Delta, &quot;the average hospital stay for COVID-19 has cost Delta $50,000 per person. This surcharge will be necessary to address the financial risk the decision to not vaccinate is creating for our company.&quot;",,,

Well i mean in our religious organization the choice to get vaccinated is person to person. But most of us in our local church are vaccinated and boostered...,,,
"I don&#39;t like the current trend of vilifying those people who are skeptical of or have concerns about the covid vaccine. Their concerns are valid and there should be an open place for discussion. My opinion (not presenting this as an ultimate truth) is that the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine has not been proven to be high enough (especially against new variants) to justify making it mandatory for all. I&#39;m disappointed with the vaccine, although I accept that no vaccine is 100% efficient. With covid vaccine the standard is below acceptable. More humane approach to combat covid would be to educate the public and especially reach out to risk groups and this way try to motivate them to get vaccinated. Maybe offer a better health insurance program for those who get the vaccine (financial long term benefit as a carrot). If someone does not want to get vaccinated there should be the choice to do so (without risking your job!), but a financial accountability/responsibility could be applied in case of the illness. No one should be discriminated if they don&#39;t want the vaccine, because there is not enough proof that it would prevent the spread of the disease. While covid itself is a strain for the health care systems, the unnecessary testing, in patient care for people who could quarantine home and efforts focused on the healthy public are really the last straw.And yes, I&#39;m vaccinated (I was among first people to get vaccinated because of my work). I support vaccination for adults (emphasis on risk groups), but this is getting out of hand. Health care systems are losing the trust of the public due to poor handling of this pandemic.",,,

I don’t like this dude.,,,
"Well,Christians believe the vaccine is the “Mark of the beast”,So that is there reason.",,,
"Answer: This is America and you have FREEDOM to be religious. So stop with spreading false information claiming Americans are not religious. Of course some will abuse the system like ANY system. America sends out more Christian missionaries out to the world than ANY other country in the world. This video is an absurd leftist diabolical discrimination tool to shed Christians in a bad light. If you want to embrace paganism go right ahead and follow the Antichrist Papacy who are building the Abrahamic Family House in Dubai where they will build a Synogogue, Catholic Church and Mosque in one compound as Christians have foretold the foundation is being laid for the One World Religion and it&#39;s being called Abrahamia to unite monotheistic religions. So if you reject Jesus Christ you will be forced to obey the Antichrist and you can enjoy all the benefits. I like the presenter am from Africa but apparently I know more about the history of America how it was established on the basis of people seeking religious freedom looks like presenter knows nothing about the history of America or the American legal system and how Supreme Court struck down Biden vaccine mandate he&#39;s not qualified to speak about American laws presenter can thank me later for picking apart his nonsensical, unethical, unjust attack video targeted against Christians :)",,,

Usually impressed by your research but in this case you have missed the profiteering side of vaccinations. I am vaccinated but the booster is a profiteering scheme every 6 months. The evolution of biology of this virus makes it weaker. We don’t need vaccine anymore - nature is spreading the best natural vaccine - weak omicron variant. You get it and small symptoms but now we will reach here immunity between the adding of those vaccinated (like me) and those who have had Corona virus.,,,
Can you tell me how many doses are needed to maintain medium/long-term protection? 1 dose? 2 doses? 3 doses? 4 doses? 5 doses? 6 doses??....,,,
What Trevor Noah did not mention is almost 100% of religious leaders believe people SHOULD take the you know what NOT that it should be FORCED. The government says it needs to be FORCED. Big difference.,,,

"These words were spoken by Jesus Christ:Mark 7:17-23  KJV17 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him; 19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? 20 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. 21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, 22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: 23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.",,,

It&#39;s because they&#39;re strategically taking away rights to medical and philosophical exemptions. This is experimental and anything with risk must have choice.

there are more comments than likes?,,,

I&#39;m unvaccinated and know of 5 vaccinated people who caught Covid. There you go.,,,
Super spreaders,,,
Yeah we unvaccinated people yeah we are the fool ones,,,
I have a breakthrough case and my symptoms are very mild . Feel like I have allergies and low grade fever 99.5-100.1 diarrhea and chills. Few days in and feeling 90% betterMy 6 yr old vaccinated and only has a cough no fever.,,,
Because it&#39;s not a vaccine,,,
Because the vax doesn&#39;t keep anyone from getting COVID.  It only reduces the symptoms if they do get it.  That part in the federal government&#39;s guidelines about vax to prevent the spread....it was lie.,,,
Move that goalpost today,,,
Break through,,,
hmmmm.... I KNOW over  50 people who have COVID-19 AND ARE FULLY VACCINATED.  The 2 people not Vax each only had fever of 101 .,,,
Its a Clot shot. Look up Dr. Robert Malone,,,

It makes no sense to test to do the same thing, isolate and treat symptoms.",,,
More COMMON TODAY HUH? 29 times more likely for Unvaccinated? Prove that statement? They are now saying most people coming into hospitals have been Vaxxed. So why are more vaxxed testing positive for Covid than the unvaxxed? What&#39;s your numbers telling us NOW?,,,
"Followed recommendations. Got booster and yet sister tested positive. I’m waiting in hopes for a negative test, rule out from my normal health condition flare up and nasal drip lol. And boy is elder mom upset and has lost hope in the science behind the vaccine:/ guess you have to get covid at least one time to build immunity lol.",,,
So what good did it do for me to get vaccinated people that are vaccinated or still one person died from covid virus that was vaccinated if everyone would get back to me that these antibac sinaiticus make me sick,,,
Funny the unvaccinated never got covid,,,
all my friends are dying or getting sick ....they where waiting in line for it ...,,,
My Dr&#39;s office just denied my request that the person treating me at my upcoming appointment wear a mask.  They made it clear that don&#39;t believe masks are necessary.  They said the person scheduled to see me &quot;has had Covid within the past 90 days and is immune.&quot;  I now have to put off my medical needs while I find a new Dr. Mask wearing by medical staff is a HUGE problem in the Decatur area.  The majority I have had contact with don&#39;t believe in masks or vaccines and make that clear.  I have reported this situation but doubt much will change.  I&#39;m leaving this message here in the hopes that someone outside of Decatur Illinois hospital system will investigate.   This virus will never go away if medical staff are spreading it.  It will be a viscous circle for decades.,,,

Every single person i know that recently tested positive is fully vaccinated.,,,
I don&#39;t know about anyone else but if everyone has to be vaccinated for the virus to not be able to spread than how exactly is that a problem?,,,

Well and Italy it seems that everyone is testing positive and everyone is vaccinated. Being able to see these things in real time pokes all kinds of holes in these pharma company funded sciences studies. There was a party at a local disco that you could not enter without a green pass and apparently 80% of the people who went to the party tested positive. Maybe we just never noticed breakthrough infections because vaccinated people were never required to get tested,,,
"Yes lets blame people for failure of the companies lol. Just happy I won&#39;t get a tail when im 40.Side story I live in a house with 3 people who all are vaccinated and got covid and are pretty sick. Im not vaccinated and dont even have a stuffy nose, ive been in direct contact with like 15 people over the last while and never got anything",,,

And that is because it&#39;s not been properly tested, and that SHOULD BE the red flag to you that something is very wrong here. When they are jumping fences to get peopled tested that should SHOUT TO YOU that something is wrong.",,,
The vaccine is what is keeping this thing alive and the reason it is mutating. If no one would have got vaccinated this thing would run its coarse and be gone. Just a theory.,,,
No true my granddaughter had cov and she didn&#39;t even get sick at all and was fine no she didn&#39;t get the jab what about those cases like hers?They should do research about people that it didn&#39;t affect seems to me there pushing it out on every one,,,
a healthy young person catching omicron is not going to have &quot;more severe symptoms&quot; than someone their age who&#39;s vaccinated catching it lol. they both gonna be fine bc they are not the ones who should be worried about this,,,
They are testing positive because you can still get covid with the vaccines. 2 of my friends who are vaccineated with boosters are really down for the count and have been very sick due to covid.,,,
"Boosters don&#39;t work people, don&#39;t get the shot unless your Obese then get the shot...COVID loves Obese people that&#39;s the fact Jack",,,

Everyone in my house is fully VaccinatedAnd guess what all of us ended up testing positive for COVID 19,,,

Hey Joe biden stated if your vaccinated you will not contract covid boy was he wrong again and again and again worst president in American history,,,
At least half the people I know who have contracted Covid were fully vaccinated.  We do know the vaccines are very effective at making big pharma and their government business partners wealthy... wake up sheeple and think for yourselves.,,,
You are being lied to be the government.,,,

"I am all for this thing, my only concerns are how technology has slowly but surely started to distance the true self away from the person itself. Especially post the internet there has been an inverse relationship between the &#39;physicalness&#39; and &#39;virtuality&#39;I think it&#39;s better to keep it to video calls over zoom which gives enough personalization. But this metaverse thing is just taking things too far when there is really no need. With the current depression and suicide rates any more incentives to be alone &#39;phyisically&#39; could prove to be detrimental.Just food for thought - There is no doubt in the kind of problems that technology has been able to solve, and going by that people should be happier that before and not stressed. Life was supposed to be made simple and not complex. Unless the wealth inequalities reduce these technologies will continue to hamper the future generations.",,,
Sir How I can get into your Classroom Workshop? Pls reply,,,

We are building a Metaverse name  Decentralized Monsters : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmJ3ZUQb2Rw,,,
"Nothing, we are fasting the pace leading towards the end of the world. Let aside being poor and rich people, the main motives of human life will become so tiny that they will start to look useless in the minds of masses. The big corporates are bringing it. Taking control over the upcoming generations. I am not really liking it. Instead to acknowledge people about our existence, or how to survive more efficiently which our life depends on a single planet, by bringing all that is coming, we are going to produce more waste, more unhelathy bodies, more slaves for the money makers. Maybe I am wrong, maybe these things could become building bricks to the light speed technology or seems positive for living in space station and working from one place and earning and doing all other shit. But humanity is not how it seems, we are like the ads of creditors, looks really good but isn&#39;t for majority of the people. You can say, like the American dream which seems really good from the outside but burdens the person immensely and destroys some part of the life. Over the years, we have evolved but have also destroyed a lot of the only place we live and should be our top priority. As more and more facilities come by, more and more negative things are building up. And the cause and the answer to all this is.. MONEY. I hope this world doesn&#39;t change to an extent where the rich live on Mars or somewhere else while the poor live on polluted earth where we couldn&#39;t walk out without purifying masks and where we see natural disasters on a daily basis, leading the Earth to only become a piece of stone to mine out the minerals from and sell only to the people living on here but paying to those living above. The second god&#39;s, yes, rich people may think themselves like that. Yes my respect for Thanos increases everyday. Peace.",,,
"2 decades before even smartphones were considered as game changer although it changed but but but , we everyone know what&#39;s  the situation  now  I am not defaming Meta but it&#39;s  still  gonna be disaster for humankind .  In today&#39;s date people are just into their phone when meta&#39;s time will come we might see people not interacting  with eachothers . Everywhere VR boxex and further glasses may also arrive  . SACRED",,,
"In coming decades, US will introduce soft technology, China will produce 2-3 more pandemics + hardware technology and rest countries will sit at home like a beggar and will see only virtual reality,since natural world will be locked by Govt for pandemics.US and China will be become Virtual world&#39;s GOD.",,,

Great case study as always. Please be gender neutral and call it humankind and not mankind.,,,
Think school back on track again! So glad to see.,,,
I am soooo much grateful that I subscribed think school.,,,
This is not at all what the Meta is about . Firstly it has a sinister agenda and it is all about control of human lives. By 2025 the world will go in a radical shift where the course of humanity and the way humans interact will change forever. If you understand the sinister agenda you will realise the end of humanity is near. Alas for the tic tok generation who have lives dependent on social media they will be the first to fall prey to this and will be gone forever.,,,
Bro I wish I can also join the master class from you I know you are from Pimpri Chinchwad are bro,,,

Indeed the meta is the internet 3.0.. but without proper monitoring this will be the Westworld.. as scary as hell.. if a negative words from any social media can push a person to depression.. can&#39;t even imagine what would go inside this,,,
"Hey bhaiya , how can I join ur team( doing things on metaverse)",,,
"This could impact Travel, Property and many other industries",,,
"This could be next Virtual Office, no need to come at the location",,,

In the last part of video look how much all are enjoying being together learning together brainstorming together ...do we really need a virtual world a virtual object representing you and doing the same thing....,,,
Can&#39;t wait to see that workshop in Metaverse.,,,
"THINK SCHOOL  always remind me of my school days , word SCHOOL which I was afraid as older as I get till 12 standard just because I don&#39;t find those teaching that relatable in my day to day life but this school I enjoyed a lot,  in fun I have learnt so many case studies which I was never be able to understand on my own. I wish I get chance in metaverse to be as student again and U as my MENTOR",,,

This is NOT good. Not good at all.,,,
That episode of Black Mirror will gonna be awesome!,,,
I am seeing that Metaverse will be an upgraded version of Second Life.,,,
Bizarre.,,,
I ain&#39;t using this for my entire life.,,,

Why are ppl freaking out about this it’s just vr,,,
How do we make meaningful connections if our world is all digital? The scary part about this is that im 19 and my kids will have grown up in all digital,,,
dude everything the last generation said is true....,,,
Has anyone noticed that this video looks like it&#39;s been done in the metaverse?? Like mark seems more  than usual,,,
It’s giving “ ready player 1 “ vibes,,,
"What comes to mind is Quarks special holo suites. But on a serious side, I&#39;ve played games where people can do anything they want, and they end up doing nothing. Hopefully there is something to actually do, not just look at stuff stare at the other avatars. That is too boring. Street art will not do it. But if you could give everyone front row seats to the super bowl, that might do it. Or watch a concert live, but instead of back row seats, the program made instances for everyone so everyone got the best seats in the house.",,,
VR spoilt our eye !,,,
Time to go back to pagers and pay phones this is the devils work,,,
I honestly don’t like this at ALL watch how many people go koo koo  because they escaped from reality in my opinion Metaverse is evil on so many levels,,,

"I don&#39;t get it, just plain creepy",,,
"I see the potential of VR for entertainment purposes, however, I feel that Metaverse will detract from reality. It will be designed in a way to keep you in the Metaverse as long as possible and make you frequently come back for more. While the comments suggest most people feel uneased by this, I think there are a lot of people who may enjoy this escape from reality...",,,
There’s no way to stop it anyway even if some people refuse to use it.,,,

Mark is definitely an alien lizard.,,,
WALL-E world incoming.,,,
Oh gosh lol.,,,
I’m convinced mr. Zuckerberg is a fkn robot. It’s just idkkkkk. Seems weird,,,
"I mean people already play VRchat and Second Life and that kinda stuff. I think the online socializing thing might be appealing for that market. Personally I prefer to just play some games on a desktop PC, if it’s with friends we would be chatting via voip. I think there are a lot of cool and interesting things that AR could possibly do but I don’t think most people would want to be living like that 24/7. It’s more the kinda thing that people would do for a bit in the evening for fun, like playing a video game or watching some TV. As for AR I think there could be good applications specific to industries, essentially helping people do their jobs… is it really necessary for socializing? I mean… it’s pretty sad if you’re basically ignoring the real life people around you because you’re too busy online chatting with some avatar of a person.",,,
This blood sucking vampire sounds like a full blown 2 am salesman on Tv all he cares about is the Doh. Watch a guy like Elon musk at least he genuinely sounds sincere!!,,,
Mark is talking about 1 January 2222,,,
I like the idea but the fact that its becoming more than just a fun hangout VR chat thing to literally your life but in VR is just horrifying. Thank you but I&#39;ll stick to the real world.,,,

"Here is my serious take. This is fine with me just for fun, like how you play your gadget, or console. But spending all your time with it is not good at all, you need to still do what humans do. Let Mark do what he is capable of doing, enough on bashing him. You will just look like a hypocrite. Period.",,,

"We live once and once only. Life&#39;s about living in the real world, not some Metaverse. It&#39;s going too far now. Technology is supposed to aid us in our lives, not replace it. We need face to face communication, we&#39;re already too digital enough as it is.The Metaverse looks cool but this isn&#39;t right. Would be best for society if they just pulled the plug on Facebook. Mark&#39;s also due for a factory reset, so this never happens again.",,,

"While bitcoin’s wild &lt;price movements might seem random, they are often driven by the same fundamental catalysts as in the traditional markets. Some claim bitcoin is impervious to shocks that affect global finance; it’s a hedge against things like inflation and a sure bet against tides of uncertainty. Moves within traditional finance can boost or burn bitcoin’s price because they determine how easy it is for financial epicenters like Wall Street to invest in bitcoin...Keeping all this in mind, it is important to trade with the right strategy when going into the crypto world.

"I&lt;totally agree with what you are saying.  I started in crypto in August 2017, and I bought in.  I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85% during the ensuing 4 year bear market.  I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do.  I wish I had bought more.  I learned a lot about buying when there is fear in the market . I use to get shaken out and panic sell but now I buy more when I see the low prices. I started making gains from trading with help of Frank Martin Ster-ne&#39; guidance and signals.  It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research.!!!",,,

Great video! But you’re story of buying for 4 minutes straight wasn’t really needed. Maybe it’s to monetize on the YouTube algorithms. Just some constructive criticism I appreciate what you do though,,,

I’m getting irritated just listening to this story,,,
One virtual land project I&#39;m very hyped up about is TCG World.  Land is just 1 BNB for their presale.  The graphics look amazing compared to a lot of projects out there.  I highly suggest you looking into it!,,,
Would be great if you share before such sales so we can participate too,,,
"How can you shill decentralend, a dogshit game with like 500 players all time peak, but not Axie Infinity ? Big yikes on this video, usually I think you have good points, but but only established play2earn, and most played game is Axie Infinity, who&#39;re also working on their &#39;&#39;land&#39;&#39; update, but you don&#39;t even mention it ...",,,
"Feel your pain. I only got a Rare Small piece the day after. Oh well, better than nothing.",,,
"My experience was similar, though the best I got was mythic small.  I can tell you haven&#39;t done a lot of popular NFT drops as thinking you were just going to be able to casually waltz in and get one of the few thousand exalted NFTs when there were half a million people sitting on the refresh button to try to buy them was very optimistic!  Great content, keep it coming!",,,
This was hilarious,,,
"haha agreed I tried to get a Solana NFT once and same kinda thing happened so frusturating, btw don&#39;t look at your OHM right now... great content!",,,
NFT Worlds is about to pump hard $WRLD,,,
"Jesse, keen to get your thoughts on the DOA’s with the recent dip? OHM, TIME, ROME?",,,
Great work here Jesse. I have an NFT from the Coalition Crew. Owning it allows me to sponsor endanger cheetahs and join an entrepreneurs club. There is a new mint coming up next week. Would you consider doing a video on the Coalition Crew’s project?,,,
RIP DAOS,,,
Damn I should’ve invested after all lol,,,
"bullshit project stay away, only bots bought those vip pass",,,
Talk about DRIP network man!!,,,
...sounds like trying to buy a goldshell miner from goldshell :),,,
Anything like this for $50/100 lots of land?,,,
I think people look to your channel for advice on what to do because they identify with you being as they want to generate a million dollars in a year. But this video is disingenuous because this project&#39;s release date was in early mid December so by the time people look at your vid it is already super late and the market has already bought up the quality spaces. You hide behind the fact that its not financial advice yet you know people will copy your trade when you advertise the secondary market. No hate towards you just documenting your journey but for viewers watching this project set sail a while ago.,,,
"Jesse, you care to do a video on Time Wonderland Dao and the new changes they have made with Time and wanting to switch over to Wmemo ?",,,
Did you check Everdome metaverse? Presell 22 January....,,,
"that&#39;s kind of a red flag they didn&#39;t do a whitelist sale, there&#39;s a reason projects do that, the crypto space is full of developers that can make really good bots to snipe pretty much any NFT sale",,,
This is why all serious defi enthusiasts should learn to use the block explorer and interact directly with the contract--Less chance of the front-end failing or a site ddos.,,,
MAKE WONDERLAND VIDEO PLEASE JESSE,,,
How is your time and ohm  investment going?,,,
"I can feel you, I just have a small epic  but hey at least I can try the game when it&#39;s coming out",,,
"Wow I’m so glad you were able to get it! I thought all hope was lost, what an emotional roller coaster that was",,,
"Hey Jesse! Love your videous man. Got a question for you, what do you think i should buy between rare medium space or epic small space?",,,
"bithotel has a land sale on the 20th of jan, couldn&#39;t figure out where and how",,,
&#39;I&#39;m a nice guy but I was not feeling nice&#39; LMAO,,,
I am wondering if I should buy a piece of land when everdome launches.,,,
the VIP pass launch was BS :P it was insta botted,,,
"You didnt buy land, you bought space, that is actually needed to play the game! So if you are not intrested for the game why the hell you take opportunity from someone who actually want to play and use that space? Greed?",,,
"I deposited 1 day before for this project, got a good 2x flip on the medium rare one. Biggest regret not minting the large exalted  Also i can confirm the process was super frustrating. Woke up at 5am to get pissed at this.",,,
I actually invested in an epic small and it feels so reassuring you also bought in,,,
Thanks for always sharing your experiences in such a transparent way. Seeing the stressful moments and hard work you need to put in to get results can actually be really inspiring and bring some much needed perspective,,,
You should make this kind of early investing videos once u plan to invest at that time only not after u make the profit,,,
Good content,,,
Hey Jesse any chance you could drop a brief mention of the upcoming ama for those who want to figure out what the project is you’ve been discussing in one of these vids. Just a go find out deal.,,,
Jesse will u use all the spaces to play the game? If not u can hire me to play haha,,,
Please how do you guys get this info before hand. Somebody help!!,,,
"I&#39;m really happy for today . I finally got my profit of  $330,000 on my crypto investment after feeling so escatic and heavy minded that nothing good can come out of it...a big thanks to Blaine Phillips jr",,,
Pavia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,,,
Can’t wait for the THOR video,,,
"Hey Jesse, great vid as always... one question, what do you think about the future of star atlas game on solana? Very ambitious project but many suspect it could be a scam.Would love to hear your views on it",,,
"I hear your frustration, I have the same thing with all the veve drops.  I can never get one!!!",,,
Please Update us On Titano . Are You Still alive on that Project.,,,
make a video on DRIP NETWORK,,,
"I nice too see, that you ther people also struggle with launches, not loading etc. It&#39;s depressing seeing that we weren&#39;t able to get what we wanted earning way more but it&#39;s nice to be atleast part of it",,,
"Hey Jesse! Just wonder if you had a chance to get other Meta lands (not game-related) or have any on your radar? I also got a few BigTime spaces, as well as a couple MetaMall plots and an Etha plot. I’m also ready for Everdome land once it comes out. I think these are prime to explode soon enough. Also looking forward to Ziliqa’s Metropolis! Thanks for the videos! ️",,,
i dont think a game that require thousands of $ to have lands in is gonna be really popular for people outside of crypto. we will see but im pretty sure 95% of gamers are not gonna play that game,,,
"Talk about persistence, glad you were able to get it. This gold rush is crazy",,,
"After Big time, nothing beats Illuvium.",,,
"Hahaha yes this sums up exactly the emotions I went through during that whole Big Time presale fiasco! I had logged in and out about 50 times and tried to purchase every type of land available, then was pleasantly surprised the next day to find out my purchase of a mythic medium space went through. So frustrating",,,
"you should buy Land in Alice, the games will be released this spring Jesse!!",,,
That frustrating experience is like 99% of NFT games and launches... I hate it all,,,
Jesse did you take down your Patreon?,,,
Come on jesseeee throw an update on titano,,,
"Great overview and insight into metaverse land — I think you’re exactly right, that traffic and users will drive the value. Best of luck with your investment!",,,

This is what i love to see! Was looking to invest into metaverse land…talked about it yesterday too amazing video! Very helpful to gather a bigger picture of the metaverse land ecosystem too!,,,
"Hey man, Still holding Rome?",,,
"there&#39;s an error with binance&#39;s chager to ethereum almost x6, i made a video&#39;",,,
"Tx again  for the content Jesse.Can you please share this oportunities with us before they launch that we can also take advantage of it buying first and not aftermarket.I got it and most of the people get it too that is not a financial advise.But if you share before ,let me make my own decision if i should buy it or not.Once you post it too late,,Whats the point?Thanks.Respect",,,

This is so much like roblox/second life,,,
"XR [VR/AR/MR] and the metaverse will live alongside real life, not replace it. I feel like a lot of people are defending &#39;the real world&#39; like it&#39;ll be replaced and they&#39;ll be left behind. VR offers amazingly FUN sweaty workouts, playing active intense games with friends around the world and lets you experience things that can&#39;t be done in real life.VR by itself does not = metaverse. Apps like VRChat, Rec Room &amp; Horizon Worlds would be considered a VR metaverse. There are also flatscreen metaverse games like Second Life, World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV [basically any MMORPG can be considered a metaverse]. Obviously XR is more immersive than flatscreen, which is why it&#39;s an exciting time to involved.I hope people can embrace the amazing things that XR offers and not be fearful of our reality fading away.",,,
I&#39;m so close to deleting all my social media at this point. Go off grid and live on a commune,,,
Something to stay away from.,,,
This is just like what they showed in Wall-E super scary,,,
Reminds me of the old game called “there”. Which I miss btw. But even more of the game that still exists “Second Life”. Same exact concept except not VR,,,
"Great video, makes me not want to get on it even more",,,
This VR thing will increase the prestige of an EYE doctor exponentially!,,,
Facebook got billions of dollars just to make a walmart Rec Room,,,
scared that this will control people’s life’s in the future,,,
Another wrecking ball for humans.,,,
HAHAHAHA If you come up in here to our platform looking like that we are all going to make fun of you in an unrelenting way. We look like Jason Momoa and Dita Von Teese and you looking like a lego mindcraft reject. I think I will wait thanks. I am not going for your downgrade sorry!!! I will stick with my SL without the stupid cumbersome headset. Your 20 YEARS BEHIND boy! Please go home!,,,

"Gaming and events -- cool.  Occasional one-off meetings -- fine.  Thinking of being able to put on a mind-blowing rock concert without any of the limitations of the physical world seems pretty cool.  That, and instead of packing an 80k person stadium, that rock band can now put on a concert for millions, if not billions, of people at the same time.Shopping in the metaverse could also be cool.  I&#39;ve used the augmented reality features of Amazon and Home Depot already, to see if something fits in my home and/or how to place it and/or how it would look.  That&#39;s a really cool capability that has helped out quite a bit.",,,
Taking the red pill or blue pill is anyones choice.Nobody is supposed to stay with the headset 24 hours though.,,,
This is a very stupid experience,,,
I know you didn&#39;t spend 24 hours in there with that stock head strap,,,
"we are scared that how the technology advancements of past few decades have affected us, same way the coming tech of metaverse will too....and slowly and slowly despite knowing the distinction between real and virtual world, people will lean towards virtual world more just the way we use our phones right now..........and the essence of real world.....would be just forgotten.! it could or could not play out like some dystopian thing.... i hope you get what i&#39;m trying to say, its amazing yet scary at the same time.............",,,
It&#39;s amazing..cant wait for all the weirdos join and we get to live happily in the real life,,,
"No thanks, I love the real word. I would more appreciate meeting in holographic imgae like in Star Wars instead of avatars.",,,
"I don&#39;t believe seeing a working metaverse until 10 years in the future: without a new generation of batterys or a wireless charging of devices over a few meter, this is bound to fail. VR is funny, but still too expensive, too niche and too slow. We can&#39;t even produce enough graphic cards for 2d; not even thinking about 3d. For this too work, mainstream-graphics needs to be much much stronger. As long as this silicon-shortage holds on, the metaverse is a bubble in the wind.",,,
"The metaverse is a great idea for humanity but i dont think it is for the planet! Imagine the amount of energy humanity consumes as it is, with the advancements in technology, the consumption of energy is bound to increase only, no matter how sustainable you try to market it as! Our planet is already suffering a lot.... with global warming, climate change, ozone layer hole, glacier melting and literally tons of issues that can endanger the whole planet, humans stay as selfish as ever.",,,
I would,,,
ive no problem with metaverse as long as im not forced to use it or live within it,,,
What a colossal WASTE OF TIME.,,,
I wonder if I could serve my jail sentence in the meta world,,,
Also there’s subliminal messages in the VR. So you can be controlled to get vaccinated and obey!!!,,,

Those who dont, will carry on their usual lives. Whats the big fuss?",,,

All aboard The Axiom!,,,
"no thank you,.",,,
Crazy to see how much fear and rejection there is from commenters - it&#39;s not the real world no but it smacks of the same time of criticism levelled at video games game in the day. &quot;you will rot your brainn!!!!&quot; and things like that. pretty ridiculous if you ask me especially given the amazing potential of such technology.The worst tarnish VR could have possibly asked for is to have facebook try and appropriate the entire landscape. Facebooks &quot;metaverse&quot; is a load of nonsense and VR will look nothing like that.,,,
Like the real world isn’t awkward and creepy enough,,,
You should have gone to second life. I&#39;ve had a business there for 12 years.,,,
wall-E,,,
"I think a lot of people in the comments are thinking too much into this and getting freaked out. The Metaverse will be how we use the internet in the future, the same way you do now but more advanced. Its not intended to fully replace the real world. You can obviously still do normal everyday things but the stuff you already do online like social media, gaming, shopping, learning, working from home and so on will all be more advanced to the point where you dont feel like you&#39;re at home by yourself in the evenings or during the day while working from home. It&#39;s just like the internt now, if you dont want to use it, you don&#39;t have to, but you&#39;ll be at a disadvantage. If you watch old videos of people in the 90&#39;s talking about the internet, it&#39;s exactly how we&#39;re disgussing the metaverse, and look at the internet now! You don&#39;t have to fully understand it  or how it works but understand that technologoly isn&#39;t going to stop advancing anytime soon. The human species is unstoppable at this stage.",,,
"I don’t think we’re going to be living in the metaverse lol, probably just use it for zoom and video games",,,

How did you keep it charged,,,
"Misleading title honestly and this has been done so many times by other VR youtubers and the results are the same such as fatigue, physical loneliness, and compatibility issues. The title should&#39;ve been 24 hours in VR, because this is not what metaverse is if you look up the definition and is certainly not out. Metaverse is the internet visualized in a single virtual world that is universal and is live always and never resets and continues to change. The best reference would be the Oasis from the movie Ready Player One. For example, going to the Amazon store in a metaverse would look like shopping in a virtual store and you can walk up and down isles and put items in your cart and then when purchased it would place the order and the items would be shipped to you. Everything in a metaverse would be interchangeable such as items and cosmetics from one game/world can be brought into a different one. What the video shows is the buggy virtual conference rooms we currently have and every company uses different versions so that is not interchangeable. I saw a comment about how even gamers are afraid of the metaverse, I completely disagree with this statement. Gamers are welcoming the metaverse, they are only afraid that one company such as Meta/Facebook would be monopolizing it. However, I do not think that will happen as it will takes multiple companies to make the metaverse run like the video said. We need a company that can handle the new virtual economy and money transfer. We need a user oriented community that continuously makes content to entertain users because if we think about it Youtube, TikTok, Instagram, etc. are only running because users constantly makes videos and contents. Other platforms like Roblox and Minecraft are still popular because of servers that users can make games and worlds in. In conclusion, this video does NOT show what a/the metaverse is and is just showing what it is like to wear a VR headset for 24 hours, even though the recommended hour is only an hour to maybe two, in the current moment of what VR has to offer. VR and the metaverse will not just pop out and into existance overnight, it will be an iterative process. I myself have a VR headset and I barely use it because of the lack of good content that keeps me entertained and also it does get uncomfortable. I am excited for VR tech to be more advanced such as smaller and lighter headsets, better/cheaper full body tracking, haptic feedbacks, and maybe even Full Dive VR. Full Dive VR is way more interesting and I suggest reading more about it, but currently it does not seem it will be available in our lifetime.",,,
"So the book by Ernest Cline &quot;Ready player  one&quot; wasn&#39;t just a science fiction, he foresaw the future :(",,,
One more platform to destroy whatever left by likes of Zuckerberg whose only intent is to make money. Do we need metaverse ? No. Just like we do not need facebook. Facebook has done more damage than good to humanity.,,,
I think this idea will fail in the long-term. May be at first people would want to try but not for long-term.,,,

"Still can’t decide whether I like the metaverse or not… On the other hand its such an amazing and inovative thing with a lot of potencial that could even go as far as providing new jobs to people, and it would be really cool hanging out with my friends from Belgium as I was their with them  (I live in Croatia). That’s really something I love about the metaverse. But their is that negative thing that it brings the same addiction as social media, and even if Zuckenberg is saying that we will be even more connected it really doesn’t seem like that…",,,

"Every mayor development in history had its beginnings.  Virtual worlds have been part pf society for a while now.

Instead of being scared and doubtful of it, make it better. Take the idea and apply yours.  This cant all be bad or wrong. Just imagine a whole world that you could visit inside virtual reality.

"Mark Zuckerberg, like many men who garnish immense power, is a sociopath, and you&#39;d be wise to never trust a sociopaths words or agenda, because they only have one persons&#39; benefit in mind.",,,
"Vice new is even worse then Facebook, with this kind of bullshit they want to control and sensor everything, thats the end goal. What they want is more control on what people say and do in FB and in the Internet, they bash FB to get more regulation on them. Companies like Vice are the scum of the earth.",,,
Ban Facebook? It&#39;s garbage. You can&#39;t do anything with it. Linkedin is better for professionals. Little kids use facebook,,,
I deleted Facebook and I would never go back it’s not jus fb it’s stealing yo life,,,
Jesus Christ our Lord God  he will return before the next generation begins,,,
"Banks and companies like the East India Trading Company used to be a scourge on humanity, now Facebook has emerged along with others adding another dimension to global structures with way more power than they should have.",,,
"I don&#39;t want to get near Metaverse. Instagram is already super toxic, linked with somo body image issue. I can&#39;t imagine how we, as social beings, could handle such an artificial social link. Not to say this enterprise did not a single thing about a genocide in Myanmar.",,,
Amogus,,,
Nope I don’t support the metverse. Mark Zuckerberg hasn’t even taken responsibility for the mess from Facebook. I’m good thanks.,,,
What is this 6 July and why is Facebook&#39;s fault???,,,
CCN - dude you are behind a rock.,,,
"I&#39;m not American so i don&#39;t understand their &#39;constitution&#39; or &#39;rights&#39;, so I&#39;m willing to admit i have no idea what i am talking about. But as an outsider what i see is this. Isn&#39;t their &#39;constitution&#39; and &#39;however many amendment they have&#39; been put in place for their freedom? Like this is why they are always screaming about their &#39;freedom&#39;. Their rights to rise against their government when they feel they are doing the wrong thing. The right to &#39;revolutionise&#39;?  hence all the guns. (like guns will stop their military with all their advance weapons) lol, but hey i get the reason, F*** the government. you know what F*** mine too, its s***.So to me and my understanding, why is storming the capitol illegal? don&#39;t your amended rights allow you to do such s***? Like what are people going to jail for, when you can &#39;bare arms&#39;. Are you not patriotically required to do things like storming the capital when you feel like they are screwing you over? I really don&#39;t understand your freedoms. All i see is the freedom to get arrested or shot.",,,
2020 : The end is Near! 2022 : The end is Here!,,,
Metaverse is a great tech. It is the future. Maybe not under Zuckerberg&#39;s leadership. Didn&#39;t you see his face? His face tells it all.,,,

"Vice&#39;s reporting is so deceptive in how they continually use the Jan 6th Capitol situation to promote this story when it was the MULTIPLE legitimate riots and murderous and destructive incidents all over the US in 2020. Facebook was used to ACTUALLY organize and commit deadly violence and millions in property damage, but they&#39;re lost to history now because of political reasons?? When you use CNN to support your story from the start, its going to be questionable throughout. It seems like Vice can be better than this.",,,
LOCK YOU IN VIRTUAL WORLD .... AND THE WORLD IS BURNNING AROUND YOU ... THIS BOT  KNOWS HOW TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO DISTRACT  YOU,,,
Jan 6th going to play out in the meta verse we must stop this virtual craziness!!,,,
"Imagine its only one minute in and we already checkd off:* Capitalism bad hurrdurr* Technological Advancement bad hurrdurr ( Like how they made the implicit connection between a dystopian skynet metaverse, and actual space travel)* Literally one minute Mark: muh insurrection with less than 2 direct casualties and a total interruption of service of a few hours, after which everything went as it should haveCome on.",,,
We need more censorship to be protected from misinformation? And who decides what misinformation is? Your ideas are dangerous for our democracy.,,,
"I think this is all bullshit. People want to point at Facebook and social platforms as being the reason for hate and division in society when the root of the problem is elsewhere. They are not god and do not get to decide who to censor/deplatform without introducing some sort of bias. The truth, and root, of all the conflicts we see today are consequences of multiculturalism. Multiculturalism simply doesn&#39;t work, whether we like it or not. That is the truth",,,
Cryptocoins are the worst when in future everyone must use cryptocoins for online transactions,,,

Facebook is evil,,,
Futurama predicted the metaverse on S:7 E:3 attack of the killer app.,,,
"Edward Snowden wasted his time trying to help us. Zuckerberg keeps showing us why not to trust him, yet we keep trusting him. Sounds like everyone has experience in codependency because we keep going back to something thats clearly not good for us.",,,
Difficult to believe so many people continue to use Facebook knowing how others benefit from having access to the private information uploaded.,,,
"This is ridiculous. While I do not support the questionable ethics of large companies, the agenda of this video is off. They are trying to make it seem like it&#39;s the Facebook office workers who were responsible for these acts, &quot;they did nothing&quot; I am sorry, I did not know a social media web site, was in charge of protecting the capital, and is somehow in charge of Ethiopia?",,,
I dont tthink they realized its a user problem and not entirely one persons fault for being incapable of pleasing billions of people around the world,,,
Watching the tobacco companies lie about nicotine addiction is eerily similar to watching Big Pharma lie about the vaccine side effects.,,,

its literally gonna be cool for like 2 weeks and give people a massive headache we&#39;ll be ight,,,
Facebook is literally being like the big evil corporation from ready player one,,,
"Is there any way to destroy FB and it’s data and servers, permanently?",,,
So its a place where you spend real money on nothing. So its just another thing you can do to not be in reality. Ill pass.,,,
"We are already in the retardverse, I dont see how this will make much of a difference.",,,
"Why does Mark Z. even need more money? I mean, seriously, is he that greedy?!?",,,
"Metaverse is Zuckerberg&#39;s Frankestein, and it is the world he&#39;s created to hide from his own miserable existance...",,,
Mark don&#39;t even know what he&#39;s getting into. He has YET to stop and think that he&#39;s going to HAVE to establish physical police and government presence in the meta verse. He&#39;s rich. But he ain&#39;t that rich and powerful.,,,
"You know why I&#39;m NOT worried? Because I won&#39;t be participating in anything virtual reality. I&#39;ve seen enough sci-fi to know where it leads. Nor do I believe ANYTHING Facebook fact checkers tell me, if anything I believe the exact opposite. But I deleted my Facebook a year ago when I found PROOF that Facebook aids and supports child sex trafficking, the same thing we shut down MySpace for.",,,
"Left fb four years ago, don’t miss it at all",,,
I’m creating a mafia when I get into the metaverse it will be like 1970’s New York when the mafia were in their prime,,,

"Who would trust one word out of this young ultra rich, money hungry, no moraled super high hairlined frikkin weirdo????!??",,,
"Freedom is the thing that&#39;s they sought after but now they request fb as the authority to censor some information? Isn&#39;t that weird ?Information is wherever, education is main concern here. Is like tobacco, manufacture said they believe that it is not addictive but buyer or customer need to do their own due d and understand what they get into. Just a 2cent of mine.",,,
"As Uncle Ben said, with great power comes great responsibility.Facebook is powerful, but they don&#39;t want to take responsibility. That&#39;s the problem here.",,,
omg robot man,,,
"This documentaries fine and all but the creepy music and black mirror esk editing really sets a tone thats a little manipulative. Social media hasn’t really been a net negative for society as a whole, yes being chronically online is terrible for your mental health and its brought to light some of the more less than pretty aspects of human nature but as a collective its made us more aware of them. The real issue with these platforms is how insidious they are with prodding at the deepest recesses of the human mind to hold our attention and the huge negative impact over exposure to that can have on vulnerable people (IE Boomers and children)",,,
"Metaverse if the reality of true or false of  human crisis that expose corrupt government n media&#39;s, the only human know is criticism n judgementing other ,ur such a baby grow up , this is the reality of human life",,,

Wow new really brightens my day.,,,
Zuckerberg should be arrested and FB needs to be seized,,,
"It&#39;s an evil project. We all know the plan is to take over our brains for a control and make our future generations go crazy because the creators will gain wealth! What an idea! As we can clearly see that the symbol of the metaverse is infinity8, so think what it means. Even if EVERYONE thinks it&#39;s a bad idea, we still would &quot;want to enjoy the metaverse ONCE in our lifetime&quot;, and in the end, it&#39;s going to make us obsessed and last forever till it gives us brain cancer.",,,
Lol  people be on dates in the metaverse,,,
"so, let me get this straight, you are all suggesting that facebook is responsible for purely evil human interaction? Don&#39;t you think that regardless the platform, these people will get together nonetheless? IT IS NOT THE PLATFORM, IT IS THE PEOPLE. What are we going to do? ban humans from interacting with each other because it&#39;s dangerous? lol.",,,
"Huge smear against face book honestly. We know there deceptive, we know they allow this stuff to happen, however they are not responsible for the attack on the white house. There also not responsible for the ethnic war. They are just a medium that people use in order to communicate. Weather they use it for good or evil is not facebooks doing. Its the doing of the people. They were just a platform that people used in order to get the end result. This is just a propaganda statement. I used to like vice news until this article.",,,
"facebook is just the messanger, if it wasnt them itd be another social media, social media/ the internet for that matter will never be governed. people always make a way",,,

Another thing that had great potential now stiffled by the greedy.,,,
Ummm…. You can create a virtual space for free in games like Roblox or Minecraft. Or you can code your own place. It is not scarce or limited in any way whatsoever. You could create millions of virtual acres of space for pennies.,,,
Roblox is the Metaverse. Minecraft is the Metaverse. The “Metaverse” is not the real Metaverse.,,,
Lol - this is basically a massive online game of minecraft.,,,
"Isnt the Metaverse unlimited ?, as in supply can be created at will. Its not like it needs to be limited to a planet size, otherwise it would be called &quot;Metaplanet&quot;.",,,
One word from MMOs - instancing!,,,
The future is now.,,,
Time for digital homeless people.,,,
Seems to me that People in virtual reality want to roam the streets with super powers. I doubt they want tonbuy a virtual house to watch TV.,,,
As much as people may hate this we also need companies to invest into the meta verse for it become a reality. The average consumer doesn’t have this kind of money or interest to pay for the cost of the metaverse. So while companies build up their products and stuff in the metaverse they will use that to attract consumers.  It’s a love hate relationship for consumers. We want the investors but we don’t want them to invest in certain ways.,,,
Someone &#39;spiked&#39; the Kool-Aid...,,,
Sure would be a shame if instances were used over perpetual single servers.,,,
How is Ethereum Towers not mentioned here?,,,
"My question is: what&#39;s stopping me from making my own meta server where I can program in as much or little land as I want, where I want, and when I want? And, why does the location of the land matter when you&#39;re able to teleport/fast travel your avatar wherever you want? This whole thing seems ridiculous. Does anyone actually want to live in the metaverse",,,
Why?,,,
"new Second Life, it will fail miserably. Only gamers and geeks will use this. Ordinary people never will choose VR glasses instead a easy and simple  app",,,
No way this&#39;ll stick around. The VR world has had trouble getting good games out recently as it is. I&#39;ve been playing the same VR games from 2 years ago still cause there hasn&#39;t been any triple A games coming. And idk. No way anyone would pay the price of a real home for something that isn&#39;t even real. You&#39;d have to be nutz. I feel sorry for all these dumb investors.,,,
What happens if the power goes out?,,,
"Everyone  saw crypto bit ok which has value , meta is product which people have to buy  where value is measured after resale on demand which make sense if it&#39;s unique character like character like president in metaverse other wise it&#39;s like Pokemon next level",,,
"Metaverse maybe interesting but not a real world..In the end when your switch off your device, you are alone..when you switch on your device you get back the digital friend....This will be very addictive as people will get lonely when they switch off the device, so people won&#39;t stay away from it to avoid loneliness..",,,
Programmers have created a digital earth....Now people buy digital land...But they own the digital earth...,,,

Complete BS,,,
"I wonder, may be my thought is stupid, but anyway - when a number of people move to metaverse and then the current social networks like FB, Instagram,  WhatsApp ets will no longer be supported (considering they&#39;re already Meta) and become obsolete (like ICQ for example) then in order to connect with friends we would have to use metaverse and probably pay times more.

"This is so dumb, the amount of land isn’t set to a finite amount because that’s the best way for meta verse worlds to function, it’s set to a finite amount because it tricks these large companies into thinking it’s valuable. Location doesn’t matter either, it’s literally a virtual world ideally you could teleport anywhere instantly and put any view outside of your land. Look at vrchat as an example, all the worlds are free and you can make a practically infinite amount. The only things that sell for money in vrchat are artistic creations that are protected by a system that prevents them from being copied.",,,

These people have lost their minds! Colonization continues.,,,
"another get rich scheme, where a small number of people get very rich, while everyone else loses. and the result is a &#39;meta verse&#39; that is more boring, more oppressive, more exploitative than the real world.",,,
"How big is the metaverse? Also, why are people only wanting to build 3D objects on a 2D plan? Why are we not creating hyper-dimensional spaces? If the film &#39;Inception&#39; could be imagined, then why limit the metaverse to something that only replicates reality?",,,
WHILE YOU SELL YOUR PIECE OF LAND  TO BUY DIGITAL LAND THEY ARE BUYING PHYSICAL LAND,,,
Hmm...Naaa I preferer the real world.,,,
"Why would I want to spend money on fake clothes or fake trips or experiences?? Umm.. I have a real life, I want to eat real food",,,
While in most tech hubs creating the metaverse there are tent cities this guys are buying digital land.,,,
"Ppl can’t even buy property in the real world. Smh. This is such a sham. This is only for the rich, low/middle class ppl have to pay for food, home, cars, insurance, school, kids, so many things no one has time or resources to buy fake world bs. Maybe the rich but not the majority. Metaverse will fail",,,

"First, identifying &quot;The Metaverse&quot; as requiring VR to be &quot;included&quot; is a marketing thing by VR companies, specifically Facebook. Right after saying this, this goes into talking about features in Fortnite which were all in Second Life, except well Fortnite is in VR right? Um, nope, there is less than 1/10th of 1% of people who&#39;ve played Fortnite who have played it in VR since technically it doesn&#39;t even exist yet. All of the &#39;virtual land grab?&#39; Second Life also. Everyone was going to get rich on virtual land. Universities held classes in virtual space (really...) in Second Life, Oh wait... Second Life didn&#39;t even start this. There was Active Worlds 30 YEARS AGO that had vr land, university classes, concerts, night clubs, clothing, cars, space ships, sex clubs, etc... all in the virtual world. I know, I had a whole virtual world there myself. (You could purchase your own virtual world and you would show up on the list of available worlds. You could even limit who could come in, etc...) Active Worlds is still around for those who are interested in the real history of this. Upland inspired by Stranger Things? Um, nope... again, virtual real estate sales have existed for decades in Second Life. But Upland has real world addresses and NFT&#39;s you say? Well think about it, the virtual land doesn&#39;t really require NFT&#39;s since it isn&#39;t like anyone can hand out copies of your virtual world. The real world addresses? Active Worlds and Second Life had these. But you have an NFT of that real world address? No, actually, you have an NFT of that version of a real world address. There is nothing stopping someone from making another version of that real world location, and better. But it&#39;s the first, so it has historical value... Um no, since as was mentioned it&#39;s so late to the &#39;real world addresses in a virtual world&#39; that no one will care. it&#39;s a gimmick. In short, this is pure marketing bs. We need real technological breakthroughs to actually distance any version of &#39;metaverse&#39; from it&#39;s predecessors and make something people will actually care about more than 3d movies. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are real things to get excited about with VR and AR, with projects that are working towards this. The &#39;Metaverse&#39; as specked out isn&#39;t it.",,,

"OK let me just preface this by admitting that I am not a gamer but I do spend all my time online watching all sorts of videos.  I used to be a huge TV watcher but now it is 100% online. NOW... What is wrong with living a happy life online? If META-verse brings that, GREAT; right? Ben actually used those words to describe what people online and quite possibly in this new META verse would be.  He stated they wouldn&#39;t be getting married or having children.  That&#39;s a good thing, right?  Women in general do not like men.  And Men love women but for all the wrong reasons according to women.  So there is unhappiness here.  And in my opinion; bring new life to this existence is an act of cruelty.  Imagine the suffering ahead of that new life that you brought into this world. Oh yes and it can be said that there is happiness also but not near enough to make it NOT a cruel act to bring new life here.  And so what if humanity goes extinct. It would be an end to suffering.  Only lower forms of life would still be here on Earth suffering. (kill or be killed) Oh! and those religious extremest that Ben mentioned.  They would still be here too. Who thinks that religious Extremists live happy lives???",,,

"Trouble with Ben is hes the posterboy of a family photo from the 1950&#39;s. He still believes in the american dream like its utopia. Im pretty sure everyone thinks the Metaverse is a black mirror nightmare but on the other hand, just like the free market, a lot of ppl will want to escape their bland existence, their loneliness and cope, escape the hand they were dealt with and for some time be someone or something they could only dream of, in whatever ridiculous way that may be. Its why ppl play online games, watch porn, movies and tv series, its why ppls imaginations drift off and are never truly IN reality. Reality, when faced head on, its too harsh for many so ppl invent all kinds of strategies to cope, whether its telling yourself lies about life, yourself, your spouse, your job and future, relgion or some dogma, we are all, in our own way, living in our own self-created Metaverse. Now Zuckerberg is coming along and say &quot;Yeah, we get it, and here you go&quot;. I dont doubt money and privacy is a big part of it but I think we are slowly moving in the direction of candidness. We are now slowly becoming more open, more honest in our behaviours, you would never have heard terms like &#39;Depression&#39;, &#39;Anxiety&#39;, &#39;Loneliness&#39; mentioned anywhere near the rate we did back 100 yrs ago. We are seeing the very darkest parts of ppl online, in social media, via porn and worse. Privacy is now slowly eroding as ppl want truth the religion once gave them. Ppl now want to feel like they exist which means parts that they hide are now being brought to the fore.",,,

Thank you for your video. I would like to make a slight correction. You indicated that the protocol automatically buys back with the treasury allocation however when this cascade occurred the price actually dipped below backing. I believe it actually took a couple of hours for the buyback to occur. I bring this up because there were many Twitter comments from leveraged users complaining that the buyback was not &quot;automatic&quot; at backing. Some got liquidated when the price dropped below backing and actually hit their liquidation point. Love your channel btw!,,,

All it takes is getting out from behind the computer, iPad or phone and observing the real world around us. The clues are everywhere.God created our world and all we see around us. Turn your eyes away from man and put them on our creator. No one said life would be easy but God says we have eternal life if we just keep our eyes on Him instead of the evil of man. God gave us free will to chose Him instead of the Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s of our world.",,,

"As part of gen z, I must say somethin.We control the future, ourselves and clearly others. We should not abandon the internet, it is fun and intresting. We should just abandon the dumb and fake part of it. We should accept opinions, reject the horrible ones (like Toothbrush mustache man is good) and go touch grass. We should get educated, read books, educate others even if it is via internet (because the internet was made for that). We should try to see different oppinions, not just say &quot;lies&quot; like sheep and go into a feedback loop of reading what you are so sure about. We should listen to people instead of mindlessly scrolling trgough tiktok. Like so many kids of the 2010 generation are instrested if idiot#1 just roasted idiot#2 on a disstrack. Also a thing for parents: Please stop watching your stuff and listen to your children if you are not doing that, because building up 1 month of reading science or minecraft lore is hard to force to stay in. Also for parents: Video games are not dumb, you are just into the feedback loop I talked about previously thinking they create dumb people.Also this what I said will look either super intelligent or dumb, also English is not my mother language and the only reason I can speak fluently is the internet. Please correct me if I made errors, or tell me if this just look like dumb stuff, please",,,

"What really hurts is that one of my favorite stories, Ready Player One, is becoming a reality when the point of it is you never want that to become a reality. The clips of the movie adaptation were used constantly in the background and it fucking disgusts me how excited and smiley Mark Zucchini-ass is like “this will be great for everyone!”. The point of the story was how basically one big monopoly took over the world, everyone basically living in stacked trailers that are cheaply and hastily put together that climb into the sky haphazardly while the bad guys have everything they can ever want in reality and in the virtual world. We can only have useless stuff in the virtual world to make up for having nothing but lousy beds and the gadgets that keep us from ending it all.",,,
"People are crazy thinking the entire world is going to go out and spend hundreds of dollars on vr headset to sit in their living room stuck in a virtual world.

By December, I had doubled my money, only to see it vanish rapidly and the original investment plummet by around 85% during the subsequent four-year down market. I took advantage of the opportunity to accumulate more during the last four years, which was both difficult and wise. I wished I had purchased more. For the time being, I am profitable, but I intend to use my expertise to accomplish exactly what you suggest in your piece. I&#39;ve learnt from you and others, particularly my mentor Jamie Wangs, who showed me how to trade and grow my crypto from 11 to 27 bitcoin, that no one truly knows what&#39;s going to happen, and I understand you&#39;re just saying that.",,,

Thanks for that informative report. The Metaverse is here to stay. It will definitely be the future of the Internet and we can´t even slightly imageine what will be possible soon. We are building a Casino on a digital plot of land and our NFT holders are getting 50% of the profits. That wouldn´t have been imagineable some years ago.,,,

No thanks. I&#39;ve been on the Meta crap since the 90&#39;s. I much prefer meeting people in person these days cause they&#39;re much less gross that way.  Minus the viruses of course.,,,

"□■ I DID SEE The vision from Jesus: The green grass IS the green pastures in Psalm 23, and means: Everybody saw this same vision from Jesus. Surely the people is grass. ● The vision from JESUS I did see A RIVER, Curved like a &#39;C&#39;, wide as a street, The still waters having no wind on it: Who can hold the wind in his hands? ■ I did see SAND under the grass in the square pit. Meaning: What shall it profit a man should he gain the whole world and lose his soul? Or, what can a man give in exchange for his soul? ○● I did see the vision from JESUS, on the foot a Clean WHITE SOCK, on the foot, cut off: It means I fail Jesus not uplifting the HOLY SPIRIT.○● The vision from JESUS that I did see, a BLACK DIRTY FASHIONABLE SHOE on the foot, cut off: it means&quot;WHY?&quot; ○● The vision Jesus showed me, I saw the CUT-off foot DID NOT BLEED: This means I am failing Jesus not believing in HIS forgiveness of all manner of sin. ○● The vision from JESUS I did see,A mans foot cut off: The meaning of that is;One will do! ● I did see from Jesus PALM TREES, the BOTTOM DARK GREEN leaves have ORANGE RED CENTERS, The top leaves all dark green, branchless and curved trunks, weeds:I fail Jesus not getting involved.● The vision JESUS showed to me, GOLD AND SILVER RUSTED circles made only for cutting, half in half out, bigger around than my outstretched arms: I FAIL JESUS BEING SILENT ABOUT THIS VISION. ● The vision from JESUS ~ I did see a CROOKED PATH of circles, not more than 4 in a row: I fail JESUS walking a crooked path in life. ● I did see The vision from Jesus ~ BRIGHT GREEN LEAVES each the size of a hand,  on top of straight trees, in one group: I fail JESUS not tithing anonomously. ● In The vision from Jesus, above the valley of vision I did see: A BRONZE AURA around the full moon: Meaning, I  fail Jesus denying this vision. ● In The vision from JESUS, I did see The SILVER GREY TREES ALL IN A ROW, none having curves, no branches: I fail Jesus from my branchless faith. ■ The vision from Jesus ~ I did see the Square Pit: I fail Jesus not reading 2 of the old, 2 of the new, testament chapters every day (in english &#39;KJV ONLY&#39; is the Bible) ■ The vision from JESUS I did see,The DEPTH OF THE SQUARE PIT IS UNKNOWN: I fail JESUS making ultimatums and unfriendly orders. ● The vision from JESUS I did seeThe FULL MOON, white in the starless night above the Valley of Vision: I fail Jesus, blaming &amp; accusing anybody of anything. ○ The vision from Jesus ~ I did see The night sky above the valley was EMPTY OF ALL STARLIGHT: MEANING: The stars of heaven shall fall unto the earth. ■ The vision from Jesus ~ IN THE PIT I sawPEOPLE, the treasure of Jesus, cut into pieces. None bleeding. None whole. None dead, in the square pit. A head missing half his thoughts ■ The Vision from Jesus ~ the PEOPLE IN THE SQUARE PIT means; In those days men shall seek death and shall not find it. Men shall desire to die and death shall flee from him.●○■□ MAGIC is: Watching too much T.V. ~ WIZARDRY is: Selling Jesus Christ for money.~ WITCHCRAFT is: Being sluggish with the Holy Spirit. ~ SORCERY is: Using any drug without a doctors prescription. □■ The vision from JESUS he showed meSPINNING counter-clockwise: I fail JESUS doing MAGIC, WIZARDRY, WITCHCRAFT, &amp;  SORCERY. ● I did see The vision from Jesus ~ Two creatures: I fail JESUS being double tongued, double-minded, double-hearted. ● I did see the Two creatures, perverted heads, fine clothes, one cuts off mans foot, other lifts arms. Both enjoy. Niether speak any words. Standing behind the pit.● The vision from JESUS I heard only one sound. THE WHIRRING SOUND was perfectly honed: I fail Jesus when I cuss, speak ill of my brother, have impure thoughts. ●○The VISION is from Jesus. The vision is what JONAH taught in Nineveh. The vision is THE WONDERFUL WORK OF GOD the 12 Apostles told on the first day of Pentecost. IT IS THE VALLEY in the shadow of death in PSALM 23, The pearl of great wealth. It is THE VISION OF GOD written in Torah. ■ I DID SEE The vision from Jesus: The green grass IS the green pastures in Psalm 23, and means: Everybody saw this same vision from Jesus.

"The BIG PICTURE by the people who control this world, FREEMASONS!&quot;The First World War must be brought about in order to permit the Illuminati to overthrow the power of the Czars in Russia and of making that country a FORTRESS OF ATHEISTIC COMMUNISM. The divergences caused by the “agentur” (agents) of the Illuminati between the British and Germanic Empires will be used to foment this war. At the end of the war, Communism will be built and used in order to DESTROY the other governments and TO WEAKEN THE RELIGIONS.The Second World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences between the Fascists and the political Zionists. This war must be brought about so that Nazism is destroyed and that the political Zionism be strong enough to institute a sovereign state of Israel in Palestine. During the Second World War, INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM must become strong enough in order to balance Christendom, which would be then restrained and held in check until the time when we would need it for the FINAL SOCIAL CATACLYSM.The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the “agentur” of the “Illuminati” between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam and political Zionism mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion.We shall unleash the Nihilists &amp; the atheists (Russia, China) and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its HORROR will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil.Then everywhere, citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the PURE DOCTRINE OF LUCIFER, brought finally out in the PUBLIC view.This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both CONQUERED AND EXTERMINATED at the same time.”&quot;That which we must say to the crowd is, we worship a god, but it is the god one adores without superstition. To you sovereign grand inspector general, we say this and you may ONLY repeat it to the brethren of the 32nd, 31st and 30th degrees. The Masonic religion should be by all of us initiates of the HIGH DEGREES, maintained in the purity of the LUCIFERIAN DOCTRINE. YES, LUCIFER IS GOD!&quot; - Albert Pike (Was a Lawyer, Writer, Confederate General and a founder of modern day Freemasonry.) - Albert Pike published this in &quot;Morals &amp; Dogma&quot; in 1871.

Great explanations,,,
"One main thing that is flawed in your argument, and most arguments is that Web 3.0 is going to replace Web 2.0 just like Web 2.0 did with 1.0. Not true, there will still be 2.0 open internet and people who use it for free. You know why? Because it doesn’t cost anything to make to begin with compared to 3.0. Running the blockchain is high energy and I don’t really believe that there is as much value being produced for the amount it costs to make the metaverse.  It’s also very difficult to compare NFTs to real assets. Sure it’s true that people can value things however they want to. But at the end of the day it has to have some functional value or else it’s just art. Nothing in Web 3.0 has enough functional value to be make economies out of it. The music example is perfect. Your acting like people don’t already have bandcamps and don’t already charge for their music to be heard. It’s a thing… but guess what, the subscription companies are dominating that market the blockchain will NOT change that.",,,

"The weirdest and most concerning thing I see about the metaverse is the way that they will make profit. They are selling literally nothing for insane amounts of money. Before the metaverse, big tech companies and social media would profit from your attention and profit from brainwashing you with ads while you scroll for hours on their app. I am sure the metaverse will do this as well but they are also just straight up selling digital space or an image. It’s the same reason people have issues with NFTs, you are buying something for a ridiculous amount of real money that meta can create for free or next to nothing. I heard snoop dogg bought a house in the metaverse for a few million. What sense does that make at all. We are all about to get scammed of our money, conscious, psyche, and reality.",,,
"VR is, when done correctly, an intimate way to interact with unreality for a short period of time. It&#39;s why videogames and chat hubs do so well on VR. What Meta is trying to do is comically villainous, Facebook, the company notorious for stealing and selling your information, spreading fake news like a disease, and hosting human trafficking rings, suddenly wants to replace reality with an eternal hell of advertisements and commercialism? No thank you, nobody is stupid enough to take that pill, except maybe this channel, all I can hope for is that it&#39;s expensive, and it fails miserably.",,,

This is the step where we can stop the war in reality right? As we are focus in online web 3.0 as we individual own the internet. Whats the point of country taking lands? We can just settle it in internet. Maybe that will be so much fun as we avoid the death of people in reality,,,
"For the uneducated: it&#39;s just buying pixels.For the educated: you can become a digital real estate investor in the next 10 years!So... A pixel investor? XDOk, but for real. The thing with selling your art as nft and getting 80% of every sell sounds really cool, I think this is finally something that will make artist earn as much as they really deserve. But buying parts of the internet? I get the idea (or so I think) but won&#39;t it just end up as buying land/goods in real life? I feel like with giant companies such as google, facebook, nike, cocacola, disney etc. we, people, already lost in this &#39;&#39;buying parts of the internet&#39;&#39; race. Corporations already have all the money and reasources to make the best possible decissions while buying those parts of the internet. And sure, as we&#39;ve seen in the nowadays idea of the internet, there are individuals who made it big here. But what is the cost of making it big now? The life of a youtube/instagram/tiktok star is not as nice as people might imagine. Or, to be specific, it&#39;s not for everyone. You have to constantly monitor a huge amount of social media every day and it can really become tiring mentally. And what will be the cost of money and fame in the metaverse? The biological cost? For us, humans and for the environment? I&#39;ll remain skeptical of the idea of making a whole life in metaverse. Work and some parts of the entertainment? Sure, why not, it&#39;ll surely make some things easier but I don&#39;t feel crazy about this idea.",,,

"Happy New Year.. While bitcoin’s wild &lt;price movements might seem random, they are often driven by the same fundamental catalysts as in the traditional markets. Some claim bitcoin is impervious to shocks that affect global finance; it’s a hedge against things like inflation and a sure bet against tides of uncertainty. Moves within traditional finance can boost or burn bitcoin’s price because they determine how easy it is for financial epicenters like Wall Street to invest in bitcoin...Keeping all this in mind, it is important to trade with the right strategy when going into the crypto world.

"What does happen to NFTs when, let&#39;s say, an EMP strikes in? All data being deleted... I guess the NFTs are gone as well like all crypto, all your FIAT normal bank account holdings, everything digital would be lost right? No matter there once was a coded NFT or not right? And in fact, even if you own tons of NFTs but you do not own a mobile phone, computer or any device with a screen to watch or show them on, you maybe &quot;have&quot; them but still have no real use to them.Besides, for very long years now, people/players are annoyed as fuck when it comes to pay-to-win games where you can spend money on better equipment or just cosmetical stuff like uniforms or avatars... now, with this NFT &quot;tech&quot; this is put to another level... it is said that you now can earn money with it, rather then spending money on such stuff but with the pay-to-win games, you can still play without paying something. But the NFTs now or all these metaverse games for instance you need to invest to be part of the &quot;game&quot; so saying you can easily earn money with NFTs is or can be a just a very big lure or scam to make people invest money in digital stuff now, that before they dismissed as &quot;pay-to-win or just cosmetic shit&quot;. It is mentioned all the fucking time... buy land, buy ships, buy axies... stake this, stake that, breed this and so on... all these so called games are completely just about money, money money... no game, the game is just a fassade for a simple money making machine by trading currencies and staking them. And yes, some super stars or already rich crypto people are buying and selling some NFTs for big amounts of money and thus, a lot of &quot;normal people&quot; (simply not rich people so to say) will do so as well, hoping in making the big millions too but then... I guess... nobody will be there to buy these NFTs from the normal people simply because... they are unknown... rich/famous people buy from other rich/famous people or companies or companies buy from one artist but not from thousands of normal people simply because.... when a hand full of people earn tons of money, this money must be accumulated somewhere else... at the normal people who then sit on their &quot;investments&quot; into some digital pictures. In fact simple capitalism - a lot must pay so that some few can profit. By the way, blockchain in general is a good idea but a waste, in my opinion, when being used for NFTs and maybe not even the metaverse thingies. Because something as the metaverse already exists since 2003 called &quot;Second Life&quot;. It just lacked some FIAT to ingame money blockchain to keep the ingame price stable. Something that is also not the case in metaverse games right now, as far as I tested them. Just watch at some of these digital &quot;land&quot; prices.... Maybe in 30+ years all this stuff will be interesting when VR is so realistic that we can really touch, feel, taste and so on even digital things. But for now, all this so called play2earn games are nothing but a scam, a disguise for an even more brutal pay2win thing - &gt; trading with cryptos, i.e. NFTs. It is no game anymore, it is brutal capitalism and simple trading and what made games funny, which are based on this, always was, it was not real, it was only digital &quot;ressources and money&quot; you could do whatever you want to and even with pay2win games you could still go in without spending a dollar. But with play2earn disguised pay2win this time is over for now because almost every meta &quot;game&quot; I checked so far was nothing but a crypto NFT trading website with mostly just a simple game in front... and for real, when it comes to star atlas for instance we have seen nothing so far, just some nice rendered video clips and nice pictures, that&#39;s it... Also... people may know the movie &quot;ready player one&quot; and yes, THIS is what all these big metaverse companies are thinking off and this is how it will get, like in the book &quot;snow crash&quot; but without the happy end like in the movie... that is something that people do not think about because they just the BLING BLING and the $$$... Yes I get this fundraising part of it for sure and also agree that it probably will take several years for most metaverse games, being created now, last year or so, to get into the final, playable version that will be available to all players, so also player who are not willing or capable of investing several thousand dollars. And ok, maybe these final, playable, versions will be much cheaper for the players so that land just costs some dollar, maybe 10$ and not like now, in several metaverse games, 100$ or even 1000$ minimum up to a level of several hundreds of thousands or even millions.But that aspect... let&#39;s say you invest 10.000$ in such a game now. No matter if star atlas, sandbox, axie infinity, decentraland, Ertha or whatsoever, there are dozens of start-ups coming up with such stuff right now... When the final game comes out and land will be cheaper so that the average player can also get into the game would mean that land that once cost me 1000$ for example will than be worth 10$?Or let us say all land is already sold out when the game launches, what happens then? Can new player not participate or do they have to buy land from existing players? For what price? The new adopted cheaper price or the initial price the player paid? Not even speaking about rising land prices due to the value next to them, on them and so on.",,,

"I think what bothers me most about all of this, is that it’s separating people from person-to-person interaction, and it just seems like these companies just want you locked into this Metaverse 24/7.

I’ll keep living in the real world, there will be lots more for me since everyone will be stuck in the metaverse.",,,

Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days. 4 Look!

The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. 5 You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence.

"Great, we&#39;re calling a conferencing application a metaverse now? Also you don&#39;t need motion capture gloves to track the moment of your fingers, Meta&#39;s VR division already has an amazing algorithm that&#39;s being used in their Oculus Quest headsets. Don&#39;t call VR headsets clunky, they&#39;re using really cool technology. Also, I&#39;m personally using a VR headset built on Microsofts Windows Mixed Reality, which is also used in the Hololens and OH MY GOD their software is such TRASH. They do not have a competent team, and while I understand how this may improve as their budget increases, the signs that I&#39;m seeing that the software is just fundamentally flawed in the way they built it, gives me the feeling that people won&#39;t see Microsoft as the reliable Metaverse platform we might at first think they&#39;ll be.Windows is a really impressive operating system but to this day there are glaring issues that still haven&#39;t been fixed. While the average user only using the most basic features of Windows won&#39;t notice, people seeing their logout button for exiting the Metaverse turn unresponsive definitely will (give a comment if you got that reference at the end)",,,

All it does is leave you with tired, dry eyes, a nice red mark around your eyes, a better feeling of nausea and a few more valuable things knocked over in your house while you try to explain your next big idea or play your average game. Not to mention the cost of VR. Over-rated and a desperate attempt to justify the spend. There is no better VR than R.

"great video Graham. I think the point about indirectly investing in the stock of companies that are major developers in &quot;meta-like tech&quot; is a great way to think about this shift, especially since this is likely a decade away from major traction. The mindset of investing long-term in companies you actually do research on is a cocnept that&#39;s lost all too often and is valuble to understand - all too often it&#39;s that get rich quick approach. Additionally, investing in cryptos that are directly involved in the metaverse paltforms or offsets that may be implemented into the programs is great too, but def is not as stragiht forward as the stocks.",,,
